# Evaluator Instruction (General)
You are given a question, a gold/canonical answer (or acceptable set), and an evaluatee's answer.
Your job is to judge whether the evaluatee answer is **correct** or **incorrect**.
Provide a short rationale (1-3 sentences) and output a final label as either "correct" or "incorrect".
