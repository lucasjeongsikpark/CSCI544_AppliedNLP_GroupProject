She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
        "output": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.\n#### 18",

Subtracting the 4 eggs used for muffins from the 16 eggs laid gives 12 eggs remaining.\n\nFinally, I'll determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. She sells each egg for $2, so multiplying 12 eggs by $2 per egg results in a total of $24 she makes each day.\n<\/think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\n1. **Total Eggs Laid per Day:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eggs Used for Muffins:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Eggs After Using for Muffins:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs} - 4 \\text{ eggs} = 12 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eggs Sold at the Farmers' Market:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Money Made per Day:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ eggs} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per egg} = \\$24\n   \\]\n\n#### [final answer]\n\\boxed{24}"
