        "question": "Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",

            "gpt35": "To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs she sells.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eggs she lays per day: \nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of eggs she consumes:\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast, and bakes muffins using 4 eggs. \nSo, in total, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.\n\nNow, let's find out how many eggs she has left to sell:\nEggs laid per day: 16\nEggs used per day: 7\nEggs left to sell per day: 16 - 7 = 9\n\nSince she sells each egg for $2, we can calculate her daily earnings:\nEggs sold per day: 9\nPrice per egg: $2\nDaily earnings: 9 * $2 = $18\n\n#### [final answer] $18",
            "vicuna": "First, I need to determine how many eggs Janet lays each day. She lays 16 eggs per day.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of eggs she uses for her muffins. She uses 4 eggs daily for baking muffins.\n\nThen, I'll find out how many eggs are left after using some for breakfast and baking. Subtracting the 4 eggs used for muffins from the 16 eggs laid gives 12 eggs remaining.\n\nFinally, I'll determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. She sells each egg for $2, so multiplying 12 eggs by $2 per egg results in a total of $24 she makes each day.\n<\/think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\n1. **Total Eggs Laid per Day:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eggs Used for Muffins:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Eggs After Using for Muffins:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs} - 4 \\text{ eggs} = 12 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eggs Sold at the Farmers' Market:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Money Made per Day:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ eggs} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per egg} = \\$24\n   \\]\n\n#### [final answer]\n\\boxed{24}"
