"The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews
Background 
             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. 
           
           
             Objective 
             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. 
           
           
             Methods 
             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. 
           
           
             Results 
             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. 
           
           
             Conclusions 
             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients’ clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers.

I’m very confused why different labs have different ranges. For example, for WBC, these are the “normal” ranges by lab -

-	LabCorp - 3.4-10.8 ([This example report]( is the range listed on my labs, even though [their website]( also says 4.5-11). 
-	Quest - 3.8-10.8 ([This]( is listed on their website).
-	[Most]( [websites]( say between 4-11.

I had a 3.7 at LabCorp (normal for them [in the ranges]( listed on my test) but that’s considered low at Quest and other websites...even LabCorps own [website]( says between a 4.5-11 is normal. 

I’m a 4 at Quest (which is normal for their ranges). But that’s still considered low on other websites. 

Does anyone know why this is? And if I need to be concerned or not about my “normal” results that seem to be low?","Nothing to be worried about. Depending upon the exact method and equipment and reagents used, every lab has to calibrate its tests, and decide upon what's ""normal"" for their lab (e.g. the values seen in 95% of their population). Every time they switch reagents, or change suppliers for a kit, or update something else, the normal range may change. (It's like buying the same shirt size from different stores - they are all different sizes even though they are supposed to be the same; or like buying the same color of paint from different paint manufacturers - the exact tint is different).","The discrepancy in white blood cell (WBC) count ranges among different laboratories is not unique to WBC counts. It's a common phenomenon across various medical tests and lab results. There are several reasons for this variation:

1. **Laboratory reference ranges**: Each laboratory establishes its own reference range based on the population it serves, the testing method used, and the equipment calibration. These ranges are often derived from the laboratory's own data and may not be identical to those used by other labs.
2. **Methodology differences**: Laboratories may use different testing methods, such as flow cytometry, hemocytometry, or automated analyzers, which can produce slightly different results.
3. **Instrument calibration**: The calibration of laboratory equipment, such as hematology analyzers, can affect the results. Different laboratories may use different calibration standards or have varying levels of equipment maintenance.
4. **Population demographics**: Reference ranges are often established based on a specific population, such as a particular geographic region, age group, or ethnic background. If the laboratory's patient population differs from the one used to establish the reference range, the results may not be directly comparable.
5. **Quality control and assurance**: Laboratories must adhere to quality control and assurance standards, such as those set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, the implementation of these standards can vary among labs, leading to differences in results.
6. **Inter-laboratory variation**: Even with standardized testing methods and equipment, there can be natural variation between laboratories due to factors like technician variability, sample handling, and environmental conditions.

Regarding your specific results:

* Your WBC count of 3.7 at LabCorp is considered normal according to their range, but low according to other websites. This suggests that LabCorp's reference range is slightly lower than the commonly cited range of 4-11.
* Your WBC count of 4 at Quest is considered normal according to their range, but low according to other websites. This indicates that Quest's reference range is also slightly lower than the commonly cited range.

In general, it's essential to focus on the results provided by your healthcare provider or the laboratory that performed the test, as they are best equipped to interpret your results in the context of your individual health and medical history.

If you're concerned about your results, you can:

1. **Discuss your results with your healthcare provider**: They can help you understand the significance of your results, especially if they are below the commonly cited range.
2. **Ask about the laboratory's reference range**: Your healthcare provider or the laboratory can provide information on the specific reference range used for your test.
3. **Consider a retest or additional testing**: If you're concerned about your results, your healthcare provider may recommend retesting or additional testing to rule out any underlying conditions.

Remember, a single abnormal result doesn't necessarily indicate a health problem. It's essential to consider the result in the context of your overall health and medical history."
"Preterminal host dendritic cells in irradiated mice prime CD8+ T cell–mediated acute graft-versus-host disease
To understand the relationship between host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and donor T cells in initiating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we followed the fate of host dendritic cells (DCs) in irradiated C57BL/6 (B6) recipient mice and the interaction of these cells with minor histocompatibility antigen- (miHA-) mismatched CD8 +  T cells from C3H.SW donors. Host CD11c +  DCs were rapidly activated and aggregated in the T cell areas of the spleen within 6 hours of lethal irradiation. By 5 days after irradiation, <1% of host DCs were detectable, but the activated donor CD8 +  T cells had already undergone as many as seven divisions. Thus, proliferation of donor CD8 +  T cells preceded the disappearance of host DCs. When C3H.SW donor CD8 +  T cells were primed in vivo in irradiated B6 mice or ex vivo by host CD11c +  DCs for 24–36 hours, they were able to proliferate and differentiate into IFN-γ–producing cells in β 2 -microglobulin–deficient ( β 2 m –/– ) B6 recipients and to mediate acute GVHD in  β 2 m –/–  → B6 chimeric mice. These results indicate that, although host DCs disappear rapidly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, they prime donor T cells before their disappearance and play a critical role in triggering donor CD8 +  T cell–mediated GVHD.","If you’re reading this, thank you. It’s been a long, 15 year  journey with my skin issues and I’m feeling hopeless this evening because through it all, I feel like I have made no real progress. 

I have acne, and I’m a 33 year old Caucasian female with fair, freckled combination skin. My acne started to get really bad about 10 years ago. I’ve tried numerous skincare routines/topical treatments. They didn’t work (although I’m not giving up on that front). Was on Minocycline for 2 years which initially worked somewhat, but it started declining in effectiveness after a year and eventually just stopped working entirely. Next, was Doxycycline which gave me the worst, month long yeast infection I’ve ever had and didn’t do much for my skin. 

From there - I stopped all acne medications for about 6 months in an effort to let my body recover from the 2 years of daily antibiotics, and let my skin go through whatever it needed to go through off meds in hopes it would clear up (naive aspirations...). I was hanging in there after 5 months of being med-free, until I picked up some kind of skin bacteria or fungus when I went camping. I had dry looking red patches on my face and In my scalp that itched. 

My doctor wasn’t exactly sure what it was, but she prescribed me Bactrim. The minute I heard she was prescribing me another stronger antibiotic, I knew right away that it was going to clear my skin and got this guilty, excited feeling like the acne med junkie that I am. Well- I was right....it cleared up the mystery dry itchy spots on my face and hair(although one of the bigger mystery patches left a pretty sizable scar which was jolting), but it also just so happened to clear my entire face better than ANYTHING ever tried before. 

For the first time in 10 years, I had next to 100% clear, glowing skin. It was such a good feeling. I could go makeup free for the first time in my life. The taste of freedom was too good, though... because I basically became addicted to Bactrim. I managed to get a couple more prescriptions for it and have been abusing the medication for 10 months, dragging out these last pills I have by taking half of a 75mg Bactrim (1/4 of the prescribed daily amount) per day. I know what I’m doing is not healthy or smart and I don’t want to cause a mutant bacteria growth/resistance within my system so I am stopping, this week. 

My questions are - why are antibiotics the only thing that clears my skin? What does that say about my system and overall health? That I need to work on my gut flora/General gut health? Even the Bactrim at this point is starting to decline in effectiveness, the same issue with antibiotics in general.

Some more info about my acne: I get all types of blemishes - closed commodones, blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads, all over my face. The closed comodones are mainly on my forehead and jawline, cystic on my cheeks and cheekbones and also my chin, whiteheads pop up everywhere randomly, and in the last 2 years there’s been a surge of blackheads that come up literally all over my whole face. I’ve never had this many issues before. (The last time I saw my skin at its worst was 10 months ago before I started Bactrim) It got really bad before I started taking Bactrim and I’m dreading what I might be going through again. 

Im also worried about scarring - I’m 33 and my skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to. Lastly, diet info: I’ve ruled dairy out as a trigger by eliminating it from my diet for 2 months and seeing no improvement. And I am about to do the same with sugar. I’m hoping someone who’s been through something similar will read this and be able to give some guidance or support. If you’ve gotten this far, thank you for reading and good luck to you all on your skin care journeys.","Acne is a chronic disease, and nothing that you do will cure it. You will grow out of the condition eventually -- there are exceptionally few 80 year olds with acne. Drugs like your oral antibiotic are thought to primarily work through inflammation reduction, but the antimicrobial effect may be related. Either way, for some it works ( You may consider a course of isotretinoin. This is the only agent that can induce a remission.","Based on the information provided, it's not directly related to the context about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in mice. However, I can try to provide some insights and potential connections to your skin issues.

The author's skin issues and experiences with antibiotics seem to be unrelated to the context about GVHD in mice. However, the context does mention the role of host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and donor T cells in initiating GVHD. 

In the context of human skin issues, the immune system plays a crucial role in the development of acne. Research suggests that an imbalance in the gut microbiome and an overactive immune response can contribute to the development of acne.

Here are some potential connections and insights based on your experiences:

1. **Gut health and acne:** The context mentions the role of host antigen-presenting cells and donor T cells in initiating GVHD. Similarly, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to an overactive immune response, which may contribute to the development of acne. Your experiences with Bactrim clearing your skin suggest that an imbalance in your gut microbiome may be contributing to your acne.

2. **Immune system and skin health:** The context highlights the role of the immune system in GVHD. Similarly, an overactive immune response can contribute to the development of skin issues, including acne. Your skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to, which may be related to an imbalance in your immune system.

3. **Antibiotic resistance and skin health:** The context mentions the potential for antibiotic resistance to develop in the system. Similarly, overusing antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, which can worsen skin issues. Your experiences with Bactrim declining in effectiveness suggest that you may be developing antibiotic resistance.

Based on your experiences and the potential connections mentioned above, here are some recommendations:

1. **Dietary changes:** You've already ruled out dairy as a trigger, and now you're considering eliminating sugar from your diet. Consider exploring other dietary changes, such as increasing your fiber intake, eating more fermented foods, and reducing your intake of processed foods.

2. **Gut health supplements:** Consider taking supplements that support gut health, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and omega-3 fatty acids.

3. **Topical treatments:** In addition to antibiotics, you've tried numerous topical treatments. Consider exploring other topical treatments, such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid.

4. **Consult a dermatologist:** Given your history of acne and your concerns about scarring, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment.

Remember that everyone's skin is different, and it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of treatments that work for you."
