"The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews
Background 
             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. 
           
           
             Objective 
             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. 
           
           
             Methods 
             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. 
           
           
             Results 
             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. 
           
           
             Conclusions 
             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients’ clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers.

I’m very confused why different labs have different ranges. For example, for WBC, these are the “normal” ranges by lab -

-	LabCorp - 3.4-10.8 ([This example report]( is the range listed on my labs, even though [their website]( also says 4.5-11). 
-	Quest - 3.8-10.8 ([This]( is listed on their website).
-	[Most]( [websites]( say between 4-11.

I had a 3.7 at LabCorp (normal for them [in the ranges]( listed on my test) but that’s considered low at Quest and other websites...even LabCorps own [website]( says between a 4.5-11 is normal. 

I’m a 4 at Quest (which is normal for their ranges). But that’s still considered low on other websites. 

Does anyone know why this is? And if I need to be concerned or not about my “normal” results that seem to be low?","Nothing to be worried about. Depending upon the exact method and equipment and reagents used, every lab has to calibrate its tests, and decide upon what's ""normal"" for their lab (e.g. the values seen in 95% of their population). Every time they switch reagents, or change suppliers for a kit, or update something else, the normal range may change. (It's like buying the same shirt size from different stores - they are all different sizes even though they are supposed to be the same; or like buying the same color of paint from different paint manufacturers - the exact tint is different).","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why different labs have different normal ranges for things like WBC. I'm a bit confused because when I got my lab results, my WBC was 3.7, which is within the range for LabCorp (3.4-10.8), but other labs like Quest and most websites say their normal range is higher, like 4.5-11. So, I'm wondering why there's such variation and if I should be worried about my 3.7.

First, I think I need to understand why different labs have different normal ranges. Maybe it has to do with how they define ""normal."" I've heard that lab ranges can vary based on the laboratory's standards, the specific test method they use, and the population they're testing. For example, children have different WBC counts than adults, and different labs might include different age groups in their reference ranges.

I also remember that WBC can vary by time of the day, stress levels, and even the phase of the menstrual cycle in women. So, maybe the lab is taking all that into account, but other labs aren't or are using a different reference population.

Then, I think about how lab tests are standardized. I know that some labs use different methods to measure WBC, like manual counting versus automated counters. Maybe these methods have slight differences, leading to different normal ranges. Or perhaps the lab uses a specific formula or adjustment based on the type of sample collected, like venipuncture vs. finger sticks.

I should also consider that the normal range is a general guideline. It's not a strict cutoff. So, even if my result is at the lower end of one lab's range but within another's, it might still be normal for me. I should look at how my result compares to the lab's specific reference range on my report.

I wonder if I should ask the lab that did my test for more information. Maybe they can explain the specific range they used and why. Also, maybe I should consult my healthcare provider to discuss what my result means in the context of my overall health and medical history.

I think about whether there's a standard or a set of guidelines that labs should follow. I recall that the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) provides guidelines for lab testing, but maybe not all labs follow them exactly, leading to variations. Or perhaps some labs are using more recent updates to their reference ranges that others haven't adopted yet.

Another thought is about the age of the reference range. If the lab's normal range is based on data from several years ago, it might not reflect current health trends or changes in the population's health status. So, maybe some labs are updating their ranges more frequently than others.

I also consider the possibility of lab errors, but I think that's less likely since the ranges are set by the lab itself. It's more about the lab's internal standards and how they define normalcy.

In terms of being concerned, I shouldn't just look at one lab's range. I should compare my result to the lab's specific range on my report. If it's within that range, it's considered normal. Also, considering other factors like my health, age, and any symptoms I'm having is important. If I'm feeling unwell, even if the lab says it's normal, I should talk to a doctor.

I think about whether there are online tools or calculators that can help interpret my results across different labs. Maybe there are resources that provide a more standardized approach to WBC counts, considering different factors like age, sex, and health conditions.

Overall, it seems like the variation in lab ranges is due to a combination of lab protocols, testing methods, reference populations, and updates to their ranges. I shouldn't be too worried unless my result falls outside the lab's specific range on my report or if I'm experiencing symptoms that require medical attention.

The variation in normal ranges for WBC among labs can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Lab Protocols and Testing Methods**: Different labs use various methods (e.g., manual counting vs. automated counters) which may produce slight differences in results.

2. **Reference Populations**: Labs may include different age groups, health conditions, and demographic data in their reference ranges, leading to variations.

3. **Diurnal and Physiological Variations**: WBC counts can fluctuate based on factors like time of day, stress, and menstrual cycles, affecting the reference range.

4. **Standardization and Guidelines**: While guidelines like CLSI provide standards, not all labs adhere to them uniformly, and some may update their ranges more frequently.

5. **Lab-Specific Adjustments**: Labs may use specific formulas or adjustments based on sample type (e.g., venipuncture vs. finger sticks).

To address your concern:

- **Consult Your Lab Report**: Check the specific range provided by your lab and compare your result within that context.
- **Understand Your Healthcare Provider's Interpretation**: Discuss your results with your provider, who can offer insight based on your overall health and history.
- **Consider Age and Health Factors**: Your age and health status play a crucial role in interpreting results.
- **Explore Online Tools**: Look for resources or tools that provide a standardized interpretation of your results across different labs.

In conclusion, while different lab ranges may vary, your result should be evaluated within the specific context of your lab's range and your overall health. If you're concerned or experiencing symptoms, consulting with a healthcare provider is advisable."
"Preterminal host dendritic cells in irradiated mice prime CD8+ T cell–mediated acute graft-versus-host disease
To understand the relationship between host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and donor T cells in initiating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we followed the fate of host dendritic cells (DCs) in irradiated C57BL/6 (B6) recipient mice and the interaction of these cells with minor histocompatibility antigen- (miHA-) mismatched CD8 +  T cells from C3H.SW donors. Host CD11c +  DCs were rapidly activated and aggregated in the T cell areas of the spleen within 6 hours of lethal irradiation. By 5 days after irradiation, <1% of host DCs were detectable, but the activated donor CD8 +  T cells had already undergone as many as seven divisions. Thus, proliferation of donor CD8 +  T cells preceded the disappearance of host DCs. When C3H.SW donor CD8 +  T cells were primed in vivo in irradiated B6 mice or ex vivo by host CD11c +  DCs for 24–36 hours, they were able to proliferate and differentiate into IFN-γ–producing cells in β 2 -microglobulin–deficient ( β 2 m –/– ) B6 recipients and to mediate acute GVHD in  β 2 m –/–  → B6 chimeric mice. These results indicate that, although host DCs disappear rapidly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, they prime donor T cells before their disappearance and play a critical role in triggering donor CD8 +  T cell–mediated GVHD.","If you’re reading this, thank you. It’s been a long, 15 year  journey with my skin issues and I’m feeling hopeless this evening because through it all, I feel like I have made no real progress. 

I have acne, and I’m a 33 year old Caucasian female with fair, freckled combination skin. My acne started to get really bad about 10 years ago. I’ve tried numerous skincare routines/topical treatments. They didn’t work (although I’m not giving up on that front). Was on Minocycline for 2 years which initially worked somewhat, but it started declining in effectiveness after a year and eventually just stopped working entirely. Next, was Doxycycline which gave me the worst, month long yeast infection I’ve ever had and didn’t do much for my skin. 

From there - I stopped all acne medications for about 6 months in an effort to let my body recover from the 2 years of daily antibiotics, and let my skin go through whatever it needed to go through off meds in hopes it would clear up (naive aspirations...). I was hanging in there after 5 months of being med-free, until I picked up some kind of skin bacteria or fungus when I went camping. I had dry looking red patches on my face and In my scalp that itched. 

My doctor wasn’t exactly sure what it was, but she prescribed me Bactrim. The minute I heard she was prescribing me another stronger antibiotic, I knew right away that it was going to clear my skin and got this guilty, excited feeling like the acne med junkie that I am. Well- I was right....it cleared up the mystery dry itchy spots on my face and hair(although one of the bigger mystery patches left a pretty sizable scar which was jolting), but it also just so happened to clear my entire face better than ANYTHING ever tried before. 

For the first time in 10 years, I had next to 100% clear, glowing skin. It was such a good feeling. I could go makeup free for the first time in my life. The taste of freedom was too good, though... because I basically became addicted to Bactrim. I managed to get a couple more prescriptions for it and have been abusing the medication for 10 months, dragging out these last pills I have by taking half of a 75mg Bactrim (1/4 of the prescribed daily amount) per day. I know what I’m doing is not healthy or smart and I don’t want to cause a mutant bacteria growth/resistance within my system so I am stopping, this week. 

My questions are - why are antibiotics the only thing that clears my skin? What does that say about my system and overall health? That I need to work on my gut flora/General gut health? Even the Bactrim at this point is starting to decline in effectiveness, the same issue with antibiotics in general.

Some more info about my acne: I get all types of blemishes - closed commodones, blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads, all over my face. The closed comodones are mainly on my forehead and jawline, cystic on my cheeks and cheekbones and also my chin, whiteheads pop up everywhere randomly, and in the last 2 years there’s been a surge of blackheads that come up literally all over my whole face. I’ve never had this many issues before. (The last time I saw my skin at its worst was 10 months ago before I started Bactrim) It got really bad before I started taking Bactrim and I’m dreading what I might be going through again. 

Im also worried about scarring - I’m 33 and my skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to. Lastly, diet info: I’ve ruled dairy out as a trigger by eliminating it from my diet for 2 months and seeing no improvement. And I am about to do the same with sugar. I’m hoping someone who’s been through something similar will read this and be able to give some guidance or support. If you’ve gotten this far, thank you for reading and good luck to you all on your skin care journeys.","Acne is a chronic disease, and nothing that you do will cure it. You will grow out of the condition eventually -- there are exceptionally few 80 year olds with acne. Drugs like your oral antibiotic are thought to primarily work through inflammation reduction, but the antimicrobial effect may be related. Either way, for some it works ( You may consider a course of isotretinoin. This is the only agent that can induce a remission.","Okay, so I'm trying to help this person who has been dealing with acne for 15 years and has had a complicated history with antibiotics. They've been on Minocycline and Doxycycline, which worked initially but then stopped being effective. They also had a bad reaction to Doxycycline with a yeast infection. After that, they stopped antibiotics for six months, but then picked up a skin infection while camping, which led them to use Bactrim again. This time, Bactrim cleared their skin better than anything else, but they ended up abusing it, taking it for 10 months and now stopping because they know it's not healthy.

They're asking why antibiotics are the only thing that works for their acne, what that says about their system and health, and if they need to focus on gut health. They also mention that their acne has gotten worse in the last two years, with more cystic acne and blackheads. They're worried about scarring and have tried eliminating dairy without success, about to try sugar next.

First, I need to understand the connection between antibiotics and acne. I know that antibiotics, especially when used topically, can kill bacteria that cause acne. But when used systemically, they can disrupt the gut microbiome, which might have an impact on skin health. The person mentions that their skin cleared up when they used Bactrim but then the effectiveness declined, which could be due to antibiotic resistance or imbalances in their gut flora.

I should consider the role of gut flora in skin health. The gut and skin are connected via the immune system and inflammation pathways. An imbalance in gut bacteria could lead to increased inflammation, which is a factor in acne. So, maybe their body's ability to handle acne is linked to their gut health.

Their history of antibiotic use might have caused dysbiosis in their gut, making their skin more prone to acne because the gut and skin share common pathways. When they stopped antibiotics, their skin got worse, which suggests that the antibiotics were keeping some bacteria in check that are now causing issues again.

They also mentioned that their skin issues started getting worse two years ago, which could be related to changes in their gut flora from the antibiotics. The surge in blackheads and cystic acne might be a sign of deeper inflammation or bacterial overgrowth.

They're worried about scarring and how their skin isn't healing as well as before. This could be due to ongoing inflammation from acne or perhaps from previous damage to the skin.

They've tried eliminating dairy, which didn't help, so maybe their issue isn't just dietary but more systemic. They're about to try eliminating sugar, which could help reduce inflammation and improve their skin, but it's a different approach.

I think the key points are:

1. Antibiotics, especially Bactrim, can clear acne because they target the bacteria responsible for it, but this comes with side effects on the gut microbiome.
2. The person's gut health is compromised, leading to skin issues. The antibiotics might have disrupted the gut flora, making it harder for their body to maintain skin health.
3. The recurrence of acne after stopping antibiotics and the worsening of symptoms suggest that their body's natural balance is off, possibly due to persistent issues in gut health.
4. They might need to address their gut health more directly, maybe through probiotics, a low-sugar diet, or other dietary changes to reduce inflammation.
5. The decline in effectiveness of Bactrim could be due to antibiotic resistance, which is a common issue, but it could also be because the underlying gut imbalance is making the treatment less effective.

I should suggest looking into probiotics to restore gut flora, maybe a low-sugar diet to reduce inflammation, and perhaps consult a dermatologist or a nutritionist who specializes in skin-gut connections. They might also benefit from topical treatments that help regulate sebum production and reduce inflammation without antibiotics.

**Answer:**

The individual's experience with acne, exacerbated by a history of antibiotic use, highlights a complex interplay between gut health, the microbiome, and skin condition. Here's a structured summary and recommendations:

1. **Antibiotic Use and Skin Health:**
   - **Effectiveness:** Antibiotics like Bactrim cleared acne due to their bacterial-killing properties, but their systemic use disrupted the gut microbiome.
   - **Side Effects:** The decline in effectiveness and recurrence of acne after stopping antibiotics suggests gut microbiome disruption, potentially leading to increased inflammation and skin issues.

2. **Gut- Skin Connection:**
   - The gut and skin are linked via immune and inflammatory pathways. Dysbiosis from antibiotics may contribute to acne by affecting these pathways.
   - The worsening of acne over two years and issues with scarring indicate ongoing inflammation, possibly exacerbated by gut imbalances.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - **Gut Health Focus:** Consider probiotics to restore gut flora and a low-sugar diet to reduce inflammation.
   - **Topical Treatments:** Use non-antibiotic options like retinoids or benzoyl peroxide to manage sebum and inflammation.
   - **Consult Experts:** Engage a dermatologist or nutritionist knowledgeable in skin-gut connections for personalized advice.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Implement dietary changes and probiotic use to support gut health.
   - Explore topical treatments to manage acne without antibiotics.
   - Regular skin checks to monitor scarring and inflammation.

By addressing both gut health and topical skincare, the individual can work towards improving their acne and overall skin health."
