Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18","To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Janet lays per day: 
16 eggs/day (from her ducks) + 3 eggs/day (for breakfast) + 4 eggs/day (for muffins) = 23 eggs/day

Now, we need to find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market. Since she lays 16 eggs per day, we subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid:
16 eggs/day (laid) - 7 eggs/day (used for breakfast and muffins) = 9 eggs/day (sold at the farmers' market)

Finally, we multiply the number of eggs Janet sells per day by the price per egg:
9 eggs/day * $2/egg = $18/day

#### [final answer] $18"
A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3","To find the total number of bolts needed, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required.

Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and it takes half that much white fiber, we need to divide 2 by 2 to find the amount of white fiber.

2 / 2 = 1

So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. 

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together to find the total number of bolts needed.

2 (blue bolts) + 1 (white bolts) = 3

#### [final answer: 3]"
