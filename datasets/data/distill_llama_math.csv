Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18","First, I need to determine how many eggs Janet's ducks lay in a day. According to the problem, the ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, I'll account for the eggs Janet uses for her own consumption. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins using 4 eggs daily. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs each day.

To find out how many eggs Janet has left after her own use, I'll subtract the eggs she uses from the total eggs laid. That's 16 - 7 = 9 eggs remaining.

Finally, Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market, and each egg is sold for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are 9 * $2 = $18.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.

1. **Total Eggs Laid per Day:**
   \[
   16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Eggs Used for Breakfast:**
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs Used for Baking Muffins:**
   \[
   4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Total Eggs Used per Day:**
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Remaining Eggs After Janet's Use:**
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. **Earnings from Selling Remaining Eggs:**
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} \times \$2 \text{ per egg} = \$18
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{\$18}

A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3","First, I need to determine how many bolts of white fiber are required for the robe. Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is 2 divided by 2, which equals 1 bolt.

Next, I'll add the number of blue fiber bolts and white fiber bolts together to find the total number of bolts needed. Adding the 2 bolts of blue fiber to the 1 bolt of white fiber gives a total of 3 bolts.
</think>

**Solution:**

We are given:
- **Blue fiber bolts needed:** 2
- **White fiber bolts needed:** Half of blue fiber

Let's calculate the total number of bolts required.

1. **Calculate white fiber bolts:**
   
   \[
   \text{White fiber bolts} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber bolts} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1
   \]

2. **Calculate total bolts:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber bolts} + \text{White fiber bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
