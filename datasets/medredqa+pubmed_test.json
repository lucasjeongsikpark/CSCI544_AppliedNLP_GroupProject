    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",
    "response": "Nothing to be worried about. Depending upon the exact method and equipment and reagents used, every lab has to calibrate its tests, and decide upon what's \"normal\" for their lab (e.g. the values seen in 95% of their population). Every time they switch reagents, or change suppliers for a kit, or update something else, the normal range may change. (It's like buying the same shirt size from different stores - they are all different sizes even though they are supposed to be the same; or like buying the same color of paint from different paint manufacturers - the exact tint is different)."

    "question": "If you\u2019re reading this, thank you. It\u2019s been a long, 15 year  journey with my skin issues and I\u2019m feeling hopeless this evening because through it all, I feel like I have made no real progress. \n\nI have acne, and I\u2019m a 33 year old Caucasian female with fair, freckled combination skin. My acne started to get really bad about 10 years ago. I\u2019ve tried numerous skincare routines/topical treatments. They didn\u2019t work (although I\u2019m not giving up on that front). Was on Minocycline for 2 years which initially worked somewhat, but it started declining in effectiveness after a year and eventually just stopped working entirely. Next, was Doxycycline which gave me the worst, month long yeast infection I\u2019ve ever had and didn\u2019t do much for my skin. \n\nFrom there - I stopped all acne medications for about 6 months in an effort to let my body recover from the 2 years of daily antibiotics, and let my skin go through whatever it needed to go through off meds in hopes it would clear up (naive aspirations...). I was hanging in there after 5 months of being med-free, until I picked up some kind of skin bacteria or fungus when I went camping. I had dry looking red patches on my face and In my scalp that itched. \n\nMy doctor wasn\u2019t exactly sure what it was, but she prescribed me Bactrim. The minute I heard she was prescribing me another stronger antibiotic, I knew right away that it was going to clear my skin and got this guilty, excited feeling like the acne med junkie that I am. Well- I was right....it cleared up the mystery dry itchy spots on my face and hair(although one of the bigger mystery patches left a pretty sizable scar which was jolting), but it also just so happened to clear my entire face better than ANYTHING ever tried before. \n\nFor the first time in 10 years, I had next to 100% clear, glowing skin. It was such a good feeling. I could go makeup free for the first time in my life. The taste of freedom was too good, though... because I basically became addicted to Bactrim. I managed to get a couple more prescriptions for it and have been abusing the medication for 10 months, dragging out these last pills I have by taking half of a 75mg Bactrim (1/4 of the prescribed daily amount) per day. I know what I\u2019m doing is not healthy or smart and I don\u2019t want to cause a mutant bacteria growth/resistance within my system so I am stopping, this week. \n\nMy questions are - why are antibiotics the only thing that clears my skin? What does that say about my system and overall health? That I need to work on my gut flora/General gut health? Even the Bactrim at this point is starting to decline in effectiveness, the same issue with antibiotics in general.\n\nSome more info about my acne: I get all types of blemishes - closed commodones, blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads, all over my face. The closed comodones are mainly on my forehead and jawline, cystic on my cheeks and cheekbones and also my chin, whiteheads pop up everywhere randomly, and in the last 2 years there\u2019s been a surge of blackheads that come up literally all over my whole face. I\u2019ve never had this many issues before. (The last time I saw my skin at its worst was 10 months ago before I started Bactrim) It got really bad before I started taking Bactrim and I\u2019m dreading what I might be going through again. \n\nIm also worried about scarring - I\u2019m 33 and my skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to. Lastly, diet info: I\u2019ve ruled dairy out as a trigger by eliminating it from my diet for 2 months and seeing no improvement. And I am about to do the same with sugar. I\u2019m hoping someone who\u2019s been through something similar will read this and be able to give some guidance or support. If you\u2019ve gotten this far, thank you for reading and good luck to you all on your skin care journeys.",
    "document": "Preterminal host dendritic cells in irradiated mice prime CD8+ T cell\u2013mediated acute graft-versus-host disease\nTo understand the relationship between host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and donor T cells in initiating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we followed the fate of host dendritic cells (DCs) in irradiated C57BL/6 (B6) recipient mice and the interaction of these cells with minor histocompatibility antigen- (miHA-) mismatched CD8 +  T cells from C3H.SW donors. Host CD11c +  DCs were rapidly activated and aggregated in the T cell areas of the spleen within 6 hours of lethal irradiation. By 5 days after irradiation, <1% of host DCs were detectable, but the activated donor CD8 +  T cells had already undergone as many as seven divisions. Thus, proliferation of donor CD8 +  T cells preceded the disappearance of host DCs. When C3H.SW donor CD8 +  T cells were primed in vivo in irradiated B6 mice or ex vivo by host CD11c +  DCs for 24\u201336 hours, they were able to proliferate and differentiate into IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells in \u03b2 2 -microglobulin\u2013deficient ( \u03b2 2 m \u2013/\u2013 ) B6 recipients and to mediate acute GVHD in  \u03b2 2 m \u2013/\u2013  \u2192 B6 chimeric mice. These results indicate that, although host DCs disappear rapidly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, they prime donor T cells before their disappearance and play a critical role in triggering donor CD8 +  T cell\u2013mediated GVHD.",

    "document": "Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder: a systematic review of treatment options\nAlthough pathological skin-picking has been documented in the medical literature since the 19th century, it has only recently been included as a distinct entity in psychiatric classification systems. In the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition and the proposed International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder (ED), also known as neurotic excoriation, psychogenic excoriation, or dermatillomania), is described as recurrent picking of skin, leading to skin lesions and significant distress or functional impairment. ED is listed as one of the obsessive\u2013compulsive and related disorders, given its overlap with conditions such as trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). Arguably, its inclusion and delineation in the diagnostic nomenclature will lead to increased awareness of the condition, more research, and ultimately in treatment advances. This systematic review aims to provide readers with an up-to-date view of current treatment options for ED. A MEDLINE search of the ED treatment literature was conducted to collate relevant articles published between 1996 and 2017. The findings indicate that a number of randomized controlled trails on ED have now been published, and that current management options include behavioral therapy (habit reversal or acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy), and medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or  N -acetyl cysteine). \n        \n           Video abstract",

The ENG-implant has both well established safety and efficacy for up to 3 years. Pharmacokinetic data on ENG show high levels at 3 years and some previous clinical research confirms efficacy beyond the current approved duration of 3 years. Today, many women, because the labeled duration has been reached, have the ENG implant removed at 3 years, increasing costs, inconvenience and risks. \n           \n           \n             STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION \n             For the first 3 years, this study was an open-label, multi-centre randomized trial comparing the 3-year ENG implant to the 5-year levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing implant. After 3 years, a subset of 390 ENG participants, consented to extended use. We compared efficacy, side effects and removal procedures of both implants. We used Kaplan\u2013Meier (K\u2013M) analysis. We included an observational cohort of copper intrauterine device (IUD) users as non-users of hormonal contraceptive method for comparative purposes. \n           \n           \n             PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS \n             The study took place in family planning clinics in seven countries worldwide. Women were enlisted after an eligibility check and informed consent, and 1328 women were enrolled: 390, 522 and 416 in the ENG-implant, LNG-implant and IUD groups, respectively. \n           \n           \n             MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE \n             Over 200 women used the ENG implant for at least 5 years. No pregnancies occurred during the additional 2 years of follow up in the ENG or LNG implant group. The overall 5-year K\u2013M cumulative pregnancy rates for ENG- and LNG- implants were 0.6 per 100 women-years (W-Y) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2\u20131.8] and 0.8 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 0.2\u20132.3], respectively. Complaints of bleeding changes were similar; however, ENG-users were more likely than LNG-users to experience heavy bleeding ( p \u00a0<\u00a00.05). The median duration of the implant removal procedure was 64 seconds shorter for the one-rod ENG-implant (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 30.5, 117.5) compared to the two-rod LNG product (IQR = 77.0, 180.0). The 2-year rate for pregnancy in the IUD group compared with the two implant groups combined was 4.1 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 2.5\u20136.5]. \n           \n           \n             LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION \n             Few women were \u226419 years old or nulligravida. Although there was no weight limit for enrolment in the study, the number of women \u226570 kg were few. \n           \n           \n             WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS \n             The results from this study corroborate previous evidence showing high contraceptive efficacy through 4 years for the ENG-implant. Data through 5 years are a novel contribution and further proof of the product's capability to provide safe and effective contraception that rivals the current 5-year LNG-subdermal implant. The findings provide valuable information for policy makers, family planning programmers and clinicians that the ENG-releasing subdermal implant is still highly effective up to 5 years after insertion. Compared to previous efforts, our study population was geographically diverse and our study had the highest number of participants completing at least 5 years of use. \n           \n           \n             TRIAL REGISTRATION \n             The trial was registered as ISRCTN33378571. \n           \n           \n             STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) \n             The contraceptive devices and funds for conduct of the study were provided by the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/World Health Organization (WHO)/UNICEF/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), Department of Reproductive Health and Research (RHR), WHO.

Apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3) is associated with hypertriglyceridemia and is therefore closely related to CHD. \n           \n           \n             Hypothesis \n             We measured apoC3 concentration change in patients with CHD before and after long\u2010term aerobic exercise. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Thirty\u2010eight patients with coronary heart disease were randomly assigned to a non\u2010exercise group (19 patients) or exercise group (19 patients). Both groups received essential drugs for CHD. The non\u2010exercise group was kept sedentary while the exercise group performed moderate\u2010intensive aerobic exercise for 8 weeks. Lipid levels and apoC3 levels were measured on the first day and 8 weeks later. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Exercise for 8 weeks led to a significant decrease in concentration of triglyceride and apoC3 compared with the baseline. Triglyceride concentration changes were positively associated with apoC3 level changes. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Aerobic exercise can improve the lipid profile.

This review discusses the imaging of the most common disease processes that affect the aorta in adults, with the primary focus being on CT and MRI.",
    "response": "Was the CT done with the specific purpose of evaluating the ascending thoracic aorta, or was it an unrelated study? I only ask because the report gives only a transverse dimension at one level of the aorta, and a sagittal dimension at another level -- that doesn't really account for the curvature of the vessel and can easily overestimate or underestimate aortic diameter. For accurate values they need to 'straighten out' the aorta ([curved multiplanar reconstruction]( on the CT."

Was on Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole up until a few hours ago.\n\nI had a perinatal abscess drained on Monday and they prescribed the above mentioned antibiotics that I took for 4 days. Yesterday early in the day I saw what I thought was a small skin rash. Then late last night I noticed the rash had spread from a small patch close to my right ankle, all the way up to my thigh. I went to see the pharmacist and she told me I needed to see a doctor, as everything was closed, and starting to have a panic attack, I went to the ER.\n\nThe doctor told me I had vasculitis and instructed me to discontinue the antibiotics immediately. She said the wound from the incision and drainage was healing well and so I didn\u2019t need more antibiotics of a different kind. I didn\u2018t think to ask more questions and left happily. I thought now that I was stopping the antibiotics, my diarrhea will finally go away.\n\nWhen I got home I googled vasculitis and it sounds like I had a pretty serious allergic reaction to the antibiotics.

    "document": "Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected vasculitis\nVasculitis presents several diagnostic challenges. Firstly, patients could present with protean clinical manifestations with a wide spectrum ranging from isolated cutaneous vasculitis to multisystem involvement. Secondly, there are several medical conditions that could mimic the presentation of vasculitis. The range of differential diagnosis is therefore broad. Thirdly, vasculitis could occur as a primary disorder or be secondary to various medical conditions. It becomes important to differentiate them, as treatment of some forms of vasculitis such as those that are secondary to infection or drugs, is different from that of primary vasculitis. Fourthly, there are several different forms of vasculitis. Some are benign and self limiting, while others have the potential to threaten vital organ function and life. It follows that a rational approach is required during evaluation of patients with suspected vasculitis.",

    "question": "A little bit of health hx: my husband has had problems with alcohol for several years. He is 29, male, half caucasian and half Native America . About three years ago, he had acute pancreatitis that led him to more seriously work on sobriety. He was mostly successful but had a brief relapse that lead to another acute pancreatitis about two years ago. Again, focused on sobriety but every couple of months would have a single-day relapse. Last year, his mother died from multi-organ failure d/t alcoholism, and he hasn't had a drink since. Despite that, he has had near constant digestive issues. Frequent vomiting. Frequent diarrhea. Could barely eat anything. I long suspected he was having ascites d/t an increasing abd girth despite eating less than a 1000 calories a day for months, but his lab values came back normal. We went to the doctor constantly but they would just give him more ondansetron with instructions to avoid fatty foods.\n\nBut about 3 months ago, I noticed he was gaining MORE weight and he was developing jaundice. Went to the hospital, and he had developed acute liver failure. The weird part- MRI showed NO cirrhosis. He was in the hospital for almost a week before they dc'd with instructions that were basically...more rest. His doctors didn't know the cause of the liver failure, but assumed because there was no cirrhosis and no evidence of cancer, he would recover. His edema became so severe he was struggling to breathe but his doctors just told him to rest more. Two weeks ago, he collapsed after getting up from the toilet and struck his head, and I called an ambulance to be safe. His K+ was 2.4. Biliruben had skyrocketed. They finally did a paracentesis and drained 4.8L. His breathing was much better, and they put him on spironolactone and furosemide. He was back home after ~5 days, and the edema was slowly disappearing. As of yesterday, I honestly couldn't see any edema in his extremities, and his stomach was significantly less distended.\n\nBut as of this morning, he was starting to act VERY confused. The final straw was when he wanted to know if the neighborhood ice cream truck had been by and could only figure out how to say \"Did the cold van ring twice?\". I was concerned that his ammonia was high (maybe his kidneys were no longer functioning? Prior to this, his doctors had said his kidneys looked fine).\n\nI guess my question is...does anyone else have an idea for what could be causing this? They've ruled out most virus and obvious causes. Obviously, he's being seen by several doctors and a hepatologist,  but they're stumped and honestly don't seem like they're trying to find a cause. Also...at this point, I really feel like his doctors are being negligent in their care of him. They keep on just expecting him to get better with NO proof that whatever caused the liver failure has resolved. I'm so frustrated and angry and scared.\n\nEdit: Just got a text from husband, and I was right about the ammonia. They're starting him on meds to counteract that. Fortunately, his kidneys are still functioning well. But I feel like this is just another bandaid they're slapping on)",
    "document": "Wet beriberi with multiple organ failure remarkably reversed by thiamine administration\nSupplemental Digital Content is available in the text \n        \n           Abstract \n           \n             Rationale: \n             Circulatory failure, especially with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), as observed in septic shock, thyrotoxicosis, and anemia, is a particular pattern that should suggest thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The clinical picture of wet beriberi secondary to thiamine deficiency only demonstrates non-specific clinical manifestations. For a diagnosis of wet beriberi, medical history is very important. Interestingly, imprisonment was also found to be related to thiamine deficiency. This article presents a rare case of wet beriberi associated with multiple organ failure (MOF) in a prison patient with years of heavy alcohol consumption. \n           \n           \n             Patient concerns: \n             The patient reported repetitive symptoms of nausea, vomiting, respiratory distress, and palpitations for a period of 1 month; dyspnea and edema for 5 days; and decreased blood pressure and urine volume for 2 days. \n           \n           \n             Diagnoses: \n             The heart failure patient had a history of dietary deficiency. Right heart catheterization showed high cardiac output (CO) and low SVR. Measurement of serum thiamine concentration was low. The most important factor was that the hemodynamic indices were remarkably reversed by thiamine administration. \n           \n           \n             Interventions: \n             The patient started treatment with thiamine (100\u200amg) by intramuscular injection, together with basic supportive care. \n           \n           \n             Outcomes: \n             The hemodynamic indices improved within 12\u200ahours after thiamine administration. Echocardiographic examinations revealed right ventricular function improvement within a few days, which were normal within a month. \n           \n           \n             Lessons: \n             A diagnosis of wet beriberi should be considered for a prison patient who has unexplained heart failure, lactic acidosis, and/or MOF. Moreover, the patient should be empirically given thiamine administration without delay.",

    "document": "Prediction of COVID-19 Infections for Municipalities in the Netherlands: Algorithm Development and Interpretation\nBackground \n             COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics.

    "document": "Primary Cilia: A Cellular Regulator of Articular Cartilage Degeneration\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease that can cause pain and disability in adults. The main pathological characteristic of OA is cartilage degeneration, which is caused by chondrocyte apoptosis, cartilage matrix degradation, and inflammatory factor destruction. The current treatment for patients with OA focuses on delaying its progression, such as oral anti-inflammatory analgesics or injection of sodium gluconate into the joint cavity. Primary cilia are an important structure involved in cellular signal transduction. Thus, they are very sensitive to mechanical and physicochemical stimuli. It is reported that the primary cilia may play an important role in the development of OA. Here, we review the correlation between the morphology (location, length, incidence, and orientation) of chondrocyte primary cilia and OA and summarize the relevant signaling pathways in chondrocytes that could regulate the OA process through primary cilia, including Hedgehog, Wnt, and inflammation-related signaling pathways. These data provide new ideas for OA treatment.",

What tests have you had done?\n\nNow, to answer your question: sleep comes in a cycle with four stages, and these stages repeat several times during the night. Each cycle lasts from 90 minutes to 120 minutes. Once you wake up you have to go through all the stages again. Depending on which stage of these cycles your sleep is interrupted, you may wake up feeling very groggy, and repeated interruptions are scientifically proven to have an impact in long-term mental and physical health. So, in short, yes - your lack of continuous sleep is probably playing a part in your mental struggles."

Objective:  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the prone body and head sleep position on severity of disease in patients with OSA after 4 weeks of adaptation to a mattress and pillow facilitating prone positioning.  Methods:  Fourteen patients with mild to severe OSA, 11 men and 3 women with a mean AHI of 26 (min, 6; max, 53) and mean ODI of 21 (min, 6; max, 51) were evaluated. Two polysomnographic (PSG) studies were performed. The first PSG study was without any treatment and the second was after 4 weeks of adaptation to the MPP for prone positioning of the body and the head.  Results:  Mean AHI and ODI decreased from 26 and 21 to 8 and 7, respectively ( p  < 0.001) with treatment. The mean time spent in the supine position was reduced from 128 to 10 min ( p  = 0.02) and the prone time increased from 42 to 174 min ( p  = 0.02) with the MPP. The mean total sleep time was 390 min during the first PSG study night without treatment and 370 min during the second night with the MPP ( p  = 0.7).

No pertinent family history except my dad has arthritis and psoriasis, and I have PCOS.\n\nQuite a long story, so bear with me. If you're interested in a difficult case, this one's for you.\n\nA month ago, I had lunch with some friends and ate a lot of dim sum. The dimsum was mostly steamed dumplings and noodles, nothing raw to my knowledge. Everyone else I ate with is also perfectly fine. I felt extremely bloated, and even after walking around all day after, the feeling didn't go away. The day after, I started getting some aching epigastric pain. It would happen before eating, and I would feel very bloated after eating anything. I assumed it was Gerd or gastritis, and took famotidine, Tums, omeprazole, none of which helped. I wasn't able to eat anything more than a few bites every meal, because of how full I felt. I went to the ER 3 days later, and they misdiagnosed me with cholecystitis. In the ER, my platelet count was low (93), hemoglobin and rbc low (10.3 and 3.19), bilirubin was high (1.8) but my white blood cell count was normal. They gave me Flagyl and Cipro to take, which actually stopped the pain but I also was on a liquid-only diet at this point.\n\nA week later, I went to a different hospital near my hometown. Was diagnosed with hepatosplenomegaly. My liver is currently 26.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension, spleen is 20.1cm. Did ultrasounds, a CT, and an MRI. Found nothing remarkable, except for a huge liver and spleen.\n\nIt's been a month now, and my symptoms are the same, except for darkened petechiae on my face and neck from low platelets. I've also been getting hot flashes and Charley horses at night. My bilirubin is now 2.2, and my liver and spleen are still enlarged. I'm still anemic. I've seen a gastroenterologist, an internist, a hepatologist, and have done tons of bloodwork and stool tests, with nothing remarkable. Mono was suspected for the longest time, but my tests were negative. Also ruled out Wilson's, lupus, hepatitis. My physician wants to do a liver biopsy next, but I doubt they will find anything there either.\n\nI'm honestly so tired of being tired all day and not having a treatment for this.

It occurs more frequently in the digestive tract, but has also been reported outside the gastrointestinal tract. This report details a case of rare hepatic anisakiasis that was initially diagnosed as metastatic rectal cancer. \n           \n           \n             Presentation of case \n             A 60-year-old male underwent radical resection for stage III rectal cancer followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for six months. Seven months after surgery, a new, 10\u202fmm diameter area of low density was seen in segment 4/8 margin of the liver on enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. Metastatic liver tumour from rectal cancer was suspected. Laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. The diagnosis was revised to hepatic anisakiasis when pathological examination revealed anisakis simplex larvae in the necrotic tissue. \n           \n           \n             Discussion \n             Anisakiasis outside of the gastrointestinal tract is a rare finding, but may be seen more frequently with the recent increase in the consumption of raw fish around the world. Hepatic anisakiasis may mimic tumours in the liver. Clinicians should consider dietary inquiry and further evaluation in patients with liver margin tumours less than 20\u202fmm in size that are not positively malignant, as hepatic anisakiasis may be a possible diagnosis. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             We report a rare case of hepatic anisakiasis which initially presented as suspected metastatic cancer.

    "response": "Listen my friend, you might get some shots in the dark on here but don't bank on it. You should have had about 100 tests and it sounds like you have -- but without seeing all of those we can't really comment too much. For example have you had all cases of viral hepatitis excluded? Ok, how about more rare infections? What imaging have you had? MRCP to rule out a plumbing issue in the biliary tree? How about an ERCP? Your low platelets and hepatosplenomegaly make me worry about cirrhosis, but I know nothing of your risk factors for cirrhosis nor if you've been tested for fibrosis in the liver. Basic takeaway: reddit is not the right place for you to get an answer, most likely. Find a good gastroenterologist/hepatologist and go from there. If your workup has been thorough so far, a liver biopsy might be a good idea for you -- if you have cirrhosis you need to know and it also may give an idea of why. Your dyspepsia may or may not be related to the liver issues but it deserves a whole other workup on it's own as well. \n\nI'm a gastroenterology/hepatology fellow by the way."

    "question": "Hello guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a 24 year old guy that lives in Mauritius. As title says, during the past 2 years, I have had over 20 abscesses (more than 1 inch) surgically removed. These abscesses never form a head and they lie under my skin, so there's no way I pop them or whatever, it needs to be opened surgically. These abscesses are so painful that I can't do anything regularly. I can't have a normal job, I couldn't go to school properly, I was always either depressed about one that was forming or in so much pain that I couldn't move properly. Most of these occur in my buttcheeks but I've had one in the back of my head, one in my armpit and recently I had two big ones in each side of my scrotum area (which was by far the most complicated ones to remove, I had to be hospitalized for 2 days each and put on general/spinal anesthesia). The ones on my buttcheeks and armpit were removed as soon as I went into ER and I didn't need to stay the night at the hospital. I stopped getting them like 3 months ago but suddenly I got 3 of them... yes, three at the same time. Two on each side of my buttcheeks and one on the side of my scrotum, so basically I cannot sit/stand/walk without pain. All of them have been surgically removed but I am still in pain because of the packing and removing/inserting wick daily which is insanely painful.\n\nDoctors have no idea what it is, they always tell me it's an ingrown hair or it's in my genetics that there's no cure or something like that. They just gave me antibiotics and they are done with me until the next time. I've never had pus tested until I had to beg the doctor to test. I've had my blood tested, no diabetes, normal chlolesterol, etc.. During my last visit to the operating theatre, I begged the doctor to take a pus swab to see if we can find a way to end this but I don't know if this will help at all but we'll get the results in 3 weeks. I don't know what type of infection/disease I have. I have been researching the internet and I've found about MRSA and HS but I don't know if this is my diagnosis. I literally don't know what to do guys, I am depressed because I know I'll get more of these, they won't stop until I find the cause. Everytime one starts to form, I take a trip to the hospital and I've been put on amoxicillin 1000/ciproquin and metronidazole so many times, they don't work but they give it to me even if I tell them that they don't work and I always have to end up waiting for it to get bigger so that I can have it surgically removed. This is a very painful condition and when I got 3 at the same time, I was preparing for an interview that I really needed as I need a job badly but unfortunately I was hospitalized. I've been having suicidal thoughts because I literally cannot do anything good with my life right now, tired of being in pain, tired of not having a job, tired of everything. Please help.\n\nInfos about me: I smoke weed and cigarettes, don't drink booze that much nowadays. I've had unprotected sex, I've never been tested for STDs, I've been on steroids (Sustanon and deca) only for 1 cycle though, very low dosage. Been on antibiotics so many times.",

    "document": "Peri-adolescent asthma symptoms cause adult anxiety-related behavior and neurobiological processes in mice\nHuman and animal studies have shown that physical challenges and stressors during adolescence can have significant influences on behavioral and neurobiological development associated with internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression. Given the prevalence of asthma during adolescence and increased rates of internalizing disorders in humans with asthma, we used a mouse model to test if and which symptoms of adolescent allergic asthma (airway inflammation or labored breathing) cause adult anxiety- and depression-related behavior and brain function. To mimic symptoms of allergic asthma in young BALB/cJ mice (postnatal days [P] 7\u201357; N=98), we induced lung inflammation with repeated intranasal administration of house dust mite extract (most common aeroallergen for humans) and bronchoconstriction with aerosolized methacholine (non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist). Three experimental groups, in addition to a control group, included: (1) \u201cAirway inflammation only\u201d, allergen exposure 3 times/week, (2) \u201cLabored breathing only\u201d, methacholine exposure once/week, and (3) \u201cAirway inflammation + Labored breathing\u201d, allergen and methacholine exposure. Compared to controls, mice that experienced methacholine-induced labored breathing during adolescence displayed a ~20% decrease in time on open arms of the elevated plus maze in early adulthood (P60), a ~30% decrease in brainstem serotonin transporter ( SERT ) mRNA expression and a ~50% increase in hippocampal serotonin receptor 1a ( 5Htr1a)  and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 ( Crhr1 ) expression in adulthood (P75). This is the first evidence that experimentally-induced clinical symptoms of adolescent asthma alter adult anxiety-related behavior and brain function several weeks after completion of asthma manipulations.",

If this continues to be a problem, there is a mediation called singulair that is a good drug for both asthma and allergies in people who have both."

    "document": "Population-wide persistent hemostatic changes after vaccination with ChAdOx1-S\nVarious vaccines were developed to reduce the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Quickly after the start of vaccination, reports emerged that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including ChAdOx1-S, could be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. We investigated the hemostatic changes after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in 631 health care workers. Blood samples were collected 32 days on average after the second ChAdOx1-S vaccination, to evaluate hemostatic markers such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, \u03b12-macroglobulin, FVIII and thrombin generation. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and active VWF. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured to study the activation of the immune system. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoside and anti-spike protein antibody titers were determined. Prothrombin and fibrinogen levels were significantly reduced after vaccination (\u22127.5% and \u221216.9%,  p  < 0.0001). Significantly more vaccinated subjects were outside the normal range compared to controls for prothrombin (42.1% vs. 26.4%,  p  = 0.026) and antithrombin (23.9% vs. 3.6%,  p  = 0.0010). Thrombin generation indicated a more procoagulant profile, characterized by a significantly shortened lag time (\u221211.3%,  p  < 0.0001) and time-to-peak (\u221213.0% and  p  < 0.0001) and an increased peak height (32.6%,  p  = 0.0015) in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls. Increased VWF (+39.5%,  p  < 0.0001) and active VWF levels (+24.1 %,  p  < 0.0001) pointed toward endothelial activation, and IL-10 levels were significantly increased (9.29 pg/mL vs. 2.43 pg/mL,  p  = 0.032). The persistent increase of IL-10 indicates that the immune system remains active after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. This could trigger a pathophysiological mechanism causing an increased thrombin generation profile and vascular endothelial activation, which could subsequently result in and increased risk of thrombotic events.",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is elicited in \u03b2-cells by saturated fatty acids. Here we show that palmitate-induced \u03b2-cell apoptosis is mediated by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. By microarray analysis, we identified a palmitate-triggered ER stress gene expression signature and the induction of the BH3-only proteins death protein 5 (DP5) and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Knockdown of either protein reduced cytochrome  c  release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in rat and human \u03b2-cells.  DP5  induction depends on inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)\u2013dependent c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase and PKR\u2013like ER kinase (PERK)\u2013induced activating transcription factor (ATF3) binding to its promoter.

    "document": "Banting Memorial Lecture 2012 Reversing the twin cycles of Type 2 diabetes\nIt has become widely accepted that Type 2 diabetes is inevitably life-long, with irreversible and progressive beta cell damage. However, the restoration of normal glucose metabolism within days after bariatric surgery in the majority of people with Type 2 diabetes disproves this concept. There is now no doubt that this reversal of diabetes depends upon the sudden and profound decrease in food intake, and does not relate to any direct surgical effect. The Counterpoint study demonstrated that normal glucose levels and normal beta cell function could be restored by a very low calorie diet alone. Novel magnetic resonance methods were applied to measure intra-organ fat. The results showed two different time courses: a) resolution of hepatic insulin sensitivity within days along with a rapid fall in liver fat and normalisation of fasting glucose levels; and b) return of normal beta cell insulin secretion over weeks in step with a fall in pancreas fat. Now that it has been possible to observe the pathophysiological events during reversal of Type 2 diabetes, the reverse time course of events which determine the onset of the condition can be identified. The twin cycle hypothesis postulates that chronic calorie excess leads to accumulation of liver fat with eventual spill over into the pancreas. These self-reinforcing cycles between liver and pancreas eventually cause metabolic inhibition of insulin secretion after meals and onset of hyperglycaemia.

    "document": "Lipotoxicity: Effects of Dietary Saturated and Transfatty Acids\nThe ingestion of excessive amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and transfatty acids (TFAs) is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The focus of this paper was to elucidate the influence of dietary SFA and TFA intake on the promotion of lipotoxicity to the liver and cardiovascular, endothelial, and gut microbiota systems, as well as on insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The saturated and transfatty acids favor a proinflammatory state leading to insulin resistance. These fatty acids can be involved in several inflammatory pathways, contributing to disease progression in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, allergy, cancer, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart hypertrophy as well as other metabolic and degenerative diseases. As a consequence, lipotoxicity may occur in several target organs by direct effects, represented by inflammation pathways, and through indirect effects, including an important alteration in the gut microbiota associated with endotoxemia. Interactions between these pathways may perpetuate a feedback process that exacerbates an inflammatory state. The importance of lifestyle modification, including an improved diet, is recommended as a strategy for treatment of these diseases.",

    "document": "Molecular Mechanisms and the Role of Saturated Fatty Acids in the Progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\nThe steady rise in Western obesity rates has been closely linked to significant increases in a multitude of accompanying health problems including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD severity ranges from simple steatosis to acute steatohepatitis, but the molecular mechanisms controlling progression of this disease are poorly understood. Recent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids (FFAs), especially saturated FFAs, may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms, both in experimental models and in NAFLD patients. This review highlights important cellular pathways involved in hepatic lipotoxicity and how the degree of intrahepatic lipid saturation controls cell fate in response to an elevated FFA load. Relevant cellular processes that have been causally linked to lipid-induced apoptosis, known as lipoapoptosis, include endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. In contrast, increased triglyceride synthesis has been shown to have a protective effect against lipotoxicity, despite being one of the hallmark traits of NAFLD. Developing a more nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression will lead to more targeted and effective therapeutics for this increasingly prevalent disease, which to date has no proven pharmacologic treatment to prevent or reverse its course.",

The internet provides a readily available source of weight reduction products, the ingredients of which are often unclear. The authors describe a case of acute hepatitis in a 20 year old woman caused by such a product purchased over the internet. \n           \n           \n             Case Presentation \n             A 20-year old woman presented with a two day history of abdominal pain, vomiting and jaundice. There were no identifiable risk factors for chronic liver disease. Liver function tests demonstrated an acute hepatitis (aminoaspartate transaminase 1230 IU/L). A chronic liver disease screen was negative. The patient had started a weight loss product ( Pro-Lean ), purchased over the internet two weeks prior to presentation.

Visual stimulation was obtained with light-emitting diode (LED) goggles. Eighteen volunteers were studied twice. The size of the activated areas in the visual cortex and the increase in signal were measured. A reproducibility ratio for size (R[size]) and for location (R[overlap]) was calculated on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             Activation was seen in 89% of the subjects. The size of the activated area was widely variable among subjects: mean, 460 +/- 284 mm2; range, 0 to 1029 mm2 in the first study in all volunteers.

    "document": "The Impact of Coffee and Caffeine on Multiple Sclerosis Compared to Other Neurodegenerative Diseases\nBackground:  The literature concerning the effect of coffee and caffeine on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with focus on fatigue is investigated in this review. Potentially clinically relevant effects were also assessed in studies concerning comparable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since the existing studies obtained very inconclusive results, we systematically reviewed these studies to summarize the evidence on the possible effects of coffee and caffeine on those disease entities. Previous studies suggested that coffee and caffeine intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing MS and other neurological diseases. \n           Methods:  The PubMed database was searched using the keywords \u201ccoffee\u201d OR \u201ccaffeine\u201d in combination with keywords for each of the different diseases. Besides the keyword search, we included studies by reference list search. Studies on the effects of coffee and caffeine on the single neurological diseases were included for this review. A total of 51 articles met our inclusion criteria. The reviewed articles assessed the impact of coffee and caffeine on the susceptibility for neurological diseases, as well as the effect of coffee and caffeine on disease progression and possible symptomatic effects like on performance enhancement. \n           Results:  Higher intake of coffee and caffeine was associated with a lower risk of developing PD. In some of the MS studies there, is evidence for a similar effect and experimental studies confirmed the positive impact. Interestingly in MS coffee and caffeine may have a stronger impact on disease course compared to effects on disease susceptibility. In ALS no such beneficial effect could be observed in the clinical and experimental studies. \n           Conclusion:  This literature assessment revealed that coffee and especially caffeine could have a preventative role in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases if provided in comparatively high doses. The systematic assessment indicates that coffee and caffeine intake must not be considered as a health risk. Additional clinical studies are needed to fully understand how far coffee and caffeine intake should be considered as a potential therapeutic approach for certain disease entities and conditions.",

Since negative D-dimer values are only useful in ruling out PE, elevated values alone should not result in excessive testing. This study assessed the diagnostic and financial yield of the D-dimer in diagnosing PE. This retrospective review of 220 medical records of patients at a South Chicago Community Hospital explored the extent of the work-up following an elevated D-dimer for a suspected PE. Patients were randomly selected with no exclusion criteria. Five of the 118 (4.2%) patients with elevated D-dimer values were diagnosed with a PE. Tests ordered based on elevated D-dimer values were billed for more than $200,000. The current diagnostic approach has been medically and financially inefficient. Patients should not be worked-up for a PE based primarily on an elevated D-dimer value. Two prominent factors, independent of PE, that result in elevated D-dimer values and were pertinent to the studied population, are age and African-American origin.

Her hands had swollen to almost twice their normal size. She had redness and blisters spreading down her hands and arms. \n\n  Within a few days, the redness and swelling showed up on her chest as well. I took her to the emergency room twice in Corpus Christi, and twice in our home town as well. The doctors at he hospital initially thought it was a sunburn that was very bad. Her hands reacted horribly to the cream and treatment given to her. The welling got worse and we lost sight of her knuckles completely. By the time we got back home and I took her to the hospital she was vomiting and running a high fever. \n\n The doctors at home still didn't know what it was, but treated her with antibiotics for cellulitis and staph infection. She was given a huge round of steroids as well. The swelling eventually faded, and the blisters went away as well. However since then her hands have stopped getting better. \n\n Now is where I really need the help.... Her hands continue to get red if she uses them for anything. Cooking, cleaning, holding things (even as simple as a piece of paper). If she goes ok complete bed rest her hands will get less red, but still won't completely improve. Her hands seem to have their own temperature. They feel like they have a fever isolated in them when the rest of her body is a normal temperature. If she uses her hands the redness comes fully back and she gets extreme pain in her hands that will last though out the night. Even going as far as waking her up from a dead sleep. \n\n  We've had two biopsies on both hands now. Many rounds of blood tests. All the tests show negative for lupus or other auto immune diseases. The biopsies show signs of inflammation, but no one can seem to give us an answer as to what the root cause may be or how to treat it going forward. The real problem here is that she has never had anything like this before, and it has completely stunted her ability to live normally. \n\n  I'm trying to help pick up the slack for her at home, but she ends up feeling guilty and starts doing things again.

I have a canker sore in my mouth that has been incredibly painful.  It's been annoying me, and I wanted to treat it.  I was somewhat familiar with benzocaine, and I thought it was relatively harmless.  I have gotten it multiple times at the dentist, and I even used a topical benzocaine numbing cream back in undergrad when I closed a heavy door on my toenail.\n\nI thought it was pretty benign stuff, so I ordered it on Amazon.  It was a 20% gel with the trade name \"Anbesol.\"  It said to apply a \"pea-sized amount\" to the affected area.  I was in a lot of pain, so I'd say I probably applied a pea and a half.  I was immediately really surprised how strong it was.  For an OTC product, I didn't expect to feel like I was literally at the dentist's office getting ready for some drilling.  I let it dissolve but then got nervous it was too strong and wiped it off.  I hope I didn't swallow any of it.\n\nI then got curious and started reading about potential benzocaine overdose online.  And I see it's been strongly implicated in methemoglobinemia.  It seems benzocaine encourages the production of methemoglobin over hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen as effectively, and a high amount of it can severely reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues.\n\nAm I really at risk for getting methemoglobinemia?  It's been about an hour since I took it.  I am concerned something could happen.  I've read that the onset is generally about two hours, so will I likely be ok if I do not develop symptoms by then?  I've also read that a lot of the cases of this are in infants given benzocaine during teething.  Is this unlikely given the fact that I'm a ~200 lb 27 year old?\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful.  It's very surprising they do not list this on the label of these medications.  There literally are no warnings whatsoever.

I was somewhat familiar with benzocaine, and I thought it was relatively harmless.  I have gotten it multiple times at the dentist, and I even used a topical benzocaine numbing cream back in undergrad when I closed a heavy door on my toenail.\n\nI thought it was pretty benign stuff, so I ordered it on Amazon.  It was a 20% gel with the trade name \"Anbesol.\"  It said to apply a \"pea-sized amount\" to the affected area.  I was in a lot of pain, so I'd say I probably applied a pea and a half.  I was immediately really surprised how strong it was.  For an OTC product, I didn't expect to feel like I was literally at the dentist's office getting ready for some drilling.  I let it dissolve but then got nervous it was too strong and wiped it off.  I hope I didn't swallow any of it.\n\nI then got curious and started reading about potential benzocaine overdose online.  And I see it's been strongly implicated in methemoglobinemia.  It seems benzocaine encourages the production of methemoglobin over hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen as effectively, and a high amount of it can severely reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues.\n\nAm I really at risk for getting methemoglobinemia?  It's been about an hour since I took it.  I am concerned something could happen.  I've read that the onset is generally about two hours, so will I likely be ok if I do not develop symptoms by then?  I've also read that a lot of the cases of this are in infants given benzocaine during teething.  Is this unlikely given the fact that I'm a ~200 lb 27 year old?\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful.  It's very surprising they do not list this on the label of these medications.  There literally are no warnings whatsoever.  When looking this up, one of the top results was a class action lawsuit for failure to adequately warn consumers about this.  Maybe I'm being a little paranoid, but this was definitely a surprise to read about.  Thanks!",
    "document": "Covid-19 Analysis: Is there an Association Between Covid-19 and Development of Cognitive Deficits?\nObjective \n             The effects of COVID-19 infection were initially thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, recent literature suggests that the virus has systemic effects, even leading to cognitive deficits. The objective of this study is to review COVID-19 related literature to determine whether there is an association between COVID-19 infection and the development of cognitive deficits. \n           \n           \n             Method \n             A search for articles relevant to COVID-19, cognitive deficits, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool (MoCA), and the geriatric population was performed on the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and APA PsychInfo databases. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Substantial evidence exists that reports an association between COVID-19 infection and cognitive decline. The studies included in this literature review surveyed distinct populations and reported cognitive deficits in COVID-19 patients as measured by a reduction in MoCA scores. While cognitive deficits were identified as partially reversible, there were still measurable deficits in cognition post-recovery compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the measured cognitive deficits were found to be much worse in the geriatric population. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Current literature shows an association between COVID-19 infection and the development of cognitive deficits. Further research should seek to characterize these cognitive deficits and determine the underlying aetiology and pathogenesis. Initiatives to develop interventions to limit or improve cognitive deficits in post COVID-19 patients is crucial, especially the elderly, given the large burden of disease within this population cohort.",

    "document": "Investigation of Long COVID Prevalence and Its Relationship to Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients sometimes experience long-term symptoms following resolution of acute disease, including fatigue, brain fog, and rashes. Collectively these have become known as long COVID. Our aim was to first determine long COVID prevalence in 185 randomly surveyed COVID-19 patients and, subsequently, to determine if there was an association between occurrence of long COVID symptoms and reactivation of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in 68 COVID-19 patients recruited from those surveyed. We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant ( p  < 0.001, Fisher\u2019s exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21\u201390 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that many long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may be the result of COVID-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation.",

Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat for patients in primary care settings. \n           \n           \n             Search methods \n             We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6, MEDLINE (January 1966 to July week 1, 2013) and EMBASE (January 1990 to July 2013). \n           \n           \n             Selection criteria \n             Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi\u2010RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications. \n           \n           \n             Data collection and analysis \n             Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted trial authors from three studies for additional information. \n           \n           \n             Main results \n             We included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. We did not identify any new trials in this 2013 update. \n             1. Symptoms \u2028\nThroat soreness and fever were reduced by about half by using antibiotics. The greatest difference was seen at day three. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 21. \n             2. Non\u2010suppurative complications \u2028\nThe trend was antibiotics protecting against acute glomerulonephritis but there were too few cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two\u2010thirds within one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.60). \n             3. Suppurative complications \u2028\nAntibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); acute sinusitis within 14 days (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and quinsy within two months (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) compared to those taking placebo. \n             4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction \u2028\nAntibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day three (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if throat swabs were positive for  Streptococcus , compared to RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97 if negative. Similarly at week one the RR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative  Streptococcus  swabs. \n           \n           \n             Authors' conclusions \n             Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non\u2010suppurative complications in high\u2010income countries requires treating many with antibiotics for one to benefit. This NNTB may be lower in low\u2010income countries. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 16 hours overall. \n           \n        \n           Plain language summary \n           \n             Antibiotics for people with sore throats \n           \n           \n             Question \n           \n           This review sought to determine whether antibiotics are effective for treating the symptoms and reducing the potential complications associated with sore throats. \n           \n             Background \n           \n           Sore throats are infections caused by bacteria or viruses. People usually recover quickly (usually after three or four days), although some develop complications. A serious but rare complication is rheumatic fever, which affects the heart and joints. Antibiotics reduce bacterial infections but they can cause diarrhea, rash and other adverse effects and communities build resistance to them. \n           \n             Study characteristics \n           \n           The review is current to July 2013 and included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. All of the included studies were randomised, placebo\u2010controlled trials which sought to determine if antibiotics helped reduce symptoms of either sore throat, fever and headache or the occurrence of more serious complications. Studies were conducted among both children and adults. \n           \n             Key results \n           \n           The review found that antibiotics shorten the duration of pain symptoms by an average of about one day and can reduce the chance of rheumatic fever by more than two\u2010thirds in communities where this complication is common. Other complications associated with sore throat are also reduced through antibiotic use. \n           \n             Quality of evidence \n           \n           The quality of the included studies was moderate to high. However, there were very few recent trials included in the review (only three since 2000), hence it is unclear if changes in bacterial resistance in the community may have affected the effectiveness of antibiotics.",

    "document": "Is alcohol consumption associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease?*\n\t\t\t\t\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common disorders with an increasing incidence and prevalence. Alcohol consumption may be a risk factor for GERD; however, the relationship remains to be fully elucidated. The results of different studies are diverse and contradictory. Systematic investigations concerning this matter are inappropriate and further well-designed prospective studies are needed to clarify the effect of alcohol on GERD.",
    "response": "You probably don't get enough electrolytes in your diet. Spasms are often brought about by low potassium and low magnesium. \n\nFurthermore, a 2010 study[^1]( found that exposure of the esophagus and stomach to alcohol may cause direct damage to esophageal and gastric mucosae. In addition, toxic acetaldehyde metalized from alcohol could affect the function of the esophagus and stomach. Furthermore, dysfunction of the LES and esophageal peristalsis and abnormal gastric acid secretion may be involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related GERD. It should be noted though that some of the science behind this needs more investigation. \n\nI would strongly consider managing the obesity and alcoholism as this cramping issue is very likely secondary to one of those or both of the aforementioned problem."

    "question": "Hello, I am a female and got the Gardasil vaccine in middle school but I also developed a Plantar wart on my foot at age 12, this was in between or prior to doses of Gardasil. I took 2 doses total as I was <15. \n\nI remember thinking, \"Don't I already have it, though?\" but because I was a kid I just shrugged. I recently developed genital warts and went for treatment, and the doctors reassured me that the strains that cause genital warts do NOT cause cervical cancer. However, if I know I've already contracted more than one strain, doesn't that point to the vaccine having been completely ineffective? \n\nI have a copper IUD so no hormonal birth control, I haven't taken hormonal birth control since 16, I quit smoking last year and I have not yet had kids - that's my biggest concern, preserving my fertility. \n\nI am almost 22 years old, I also have PCOS if that matters.

    "document": "Dermatoses of Pregnancy - Clues to Diagnosis, Fetal Risk and Therapy\nThe specific dermatoses of pregnancy represent a heterogeneous group of pruritic skin diseases that have been recently reclassified and include pemphigoid (herpes) gestationis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy ( syn . pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and atopic eruption of pregnancy. They are associated with severe pruritus that should never be neglected in pregnancy but always lead to an exact work-up of the patient. Clinical characteristics, in particular timing of onset, morphology and localization of skin lesions are crucial for diagnosis which, in case of pemphigoid gestationis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, will be confirmed by specific immunofluorescence and laboratory findings. While polymorphic and atopic eruptions of pregnancy are distressing only to the mother because of pruritus, pemphigoid gestationis may be associated with prematurity and small-for-date babies and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy poses an increased risk for fetal distress, prematurity, and stillbirth. Corticosteroids and antihistamines control pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic and atopic eruptions of pregnancy; intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, in contrast, should be treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. This review will focus on the new classification of pregnancy dermatoses, discuss them in detail, and present a practical algorithm to facilitate the management of the pregnant patient with skin lesions.",
    "response": "The Gardasil vaccine is formulated to protect first and foremost against the strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer. More recent version of the vaccine have included more of the strains that just cause warts, but it doesn't protect against every strain of HPV.

I'm 26f, 1,65m from Germany (85kg, white, vulvar skin issue, the current one since today, but have been having issues for 3 years as I have suffered from vulvodynia for 3 years now. I don't drink, I don't smoke, don't use drugs, currently taking Veregen cream). I regularly get an irritated bit of skin on my **inner right labia** that goes away with clotrimazole for some reason, but yeast infections have never been found in the lab. No one knows why.\n\nI've just returned from my obgyn after discovering a rather \"rough\" patch of skin on my **inner left labia**, which has never happened. When I say rough, I mean it feels like someone ripped the skin open. It hurts when I touch it, so naturally, I immediately went to see my obgyn for it. She went through my recent lab results (one week old) with me and took a look at everything. This rough patch of skin is near the glands, she said, but not directly at the same spot. She suspects that it might be HPV (aka warts) in a veeeery early stage. She has now given me the address of a specialist that I will see for this issue. I will see this specialist in February, they don't have any free slots before that. For the time being, she has prescribed me a cream with green tea extract that I have to apply 2-3 times a day for 2 months.\n\nNow here is the thing: When I was 12, I was vaccinated against HPV. And: I'm a virgin (yes, at 26. I don't give a fuck about it but some doctors go crazy over it). So I don't understand where that HPV infection might have come from, if it is one. I have never had ANY contact of that sort with another person, never kissed someone, never had someone else's hand down my pants.\n\nOther than that, my obgyn said that my vulva etc. looks great.

    "document": "Population-wide persistent hemostatic changes after vaccination with ChAdOx1-S\nVarious vaccines were developed to reduce the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Quickly after the start of vaccination, reports emerged that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including ChAdOx1-S, could be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. We investigated the hemostatic changes after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in 631 health care workers. Blood samples were collected 32 days on average after the second ChAdOx1-S vaccination, to evaluate hemostatic markers such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, \u03b12-macroglobulin, FVIII and thrombin generation. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and active VWF. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured to study the activation of the immune system. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoside and anti-spike protein antibody titers were determined. Prothrombin and fibrinogen levels were significantly reduced after vaccination (\u22127.5% and \u221216.9%,  p  < 0.0001). Significantly more vaccinated subjects were outside the normal range compared to controls for prothrombin (42.1% vs. 26.4%,  p  = 0.026) and antithrombin (23.9% vs. 3.6%,  p  = 0.0010). Thrombin generation indicated a more procoagulant profile, characterized by a significantly shortened lag time (\u221211.3%,  p  < 0.0001) and time-to-peak (\u221213.0% and  p  < 0.0001) and an increased peak height (32.6%,  p  = 0.0015) in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls. Increased VWF (+39.5%,  p  < 0.0001) and active VWF levels (+24.1 %,  p  < 0.0001) pointed toward endothelial activation, and IL-10 levels were significantly increased (9.29 pg/mL vs. 2.43 pg/mL,  p  = 0.032). The persistent increase of IL-10 indicates that the immune system remains active after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. This could trigger a pathophysiological mechanism causing an increased thrombin generation profile and vascular endothelial activation, which could subsequently result in and increased risk of thrombotic events.",

    "question": "In recent years I have noticed that my wound healing seems to have slowed down, and I scar more than I used to. I am mainly talking about the minor things. Like when a cat scratched my arms or a dog scratched my arms with his teeth, or other kinds of minor wounding. It takes a long time for the discolouration to disappear entirely and the wound to not be visible anymore. Example: while playing with my parents' dog he scratched my right arm with his paws. There was initially a bit of swelling but that disappeared quickly. However, even though it is about a month ago, I can still see the lines in my skin, and they weren't deep at all. There was barely any blood.\n\nIt's not just that I am so bothered by what appears to be slower wound healing. I think it's odd, and I'm wondering whether it can be a signal or symptom of some issue. I understand that 'slower' wound healing is rather vague, but it seems to really be noticeable to me compared to a couple years back. Could it for instance be diet?

Many factors can interfere with one or more phases of this process, thus causing improper or impaired wound healing. This article reviews the recent literature on the most significant factors that affect cutaneous wound healing and the potential cellular and/or molecular mechanisms involved.

    "document": "Cognitive and emotional consequences of binge drinking: role of amygdala and prefrontal cortex\nBinge drinking is an increasingly recognized problem within the UK. We have studied the relationship of binge drinking to cognitive and emotional functioning in young adults, and have found evidence for increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. Since in human studies it is difficult to understand whether such behavioural changes pre-date or are a consequence of binge drinking, we have also studied parallel behaviours in a rodent model, in which rats are exposed to intermittent episodes of alcohol consumption and withdrawal. In this model, and in parallel with our findings in human binge drinkers, and alcoholic patients who have undergone multiple episodes of detoxification, we have found evidence for impairments in aversive conditioning as well as increased impulsivity. These behavioural changes are accompanied by facilitated excitatory neurotransmission and reduced plasticity (long-term potentiation (LTP)) in amygdala and hippocampus. The impaired LTP is accompanied by both impaired associative learning and inappropriate generalization of previously learned associations to irrelevant stimuli. We propose that repeated episodes of withdrawal from alcohol induce aberrant neuronal plasticity that results in altered cognitive and emotional competences.",

The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics. The modeling techniques random forest and multiple fractional polynomials were used to construct a prediction model for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The final prediction model had an  R 2  of 0.63. Important properties for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality in the Netherlands were exposure to particulate matter with diameters <10 \u03bcm (PM10) in the air, the percentage of Labour party voters, and the number of children in a household. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Data about municipality properties in relation to the cumulative number of confirmed infections in a municipality in the Netherlands can give insight into the most important properties of a municipality for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality. This insight can provide policy makers with tools to cope with COVID-19 and may also be of value in the event of a future pandemic, so that municipalities are better prepared.",

Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI  z  scores ( z BMI), diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified:  socially engaged  (35/214, 16.3%),  independently engaged  (18/214, 8.4%) ( socially  and  independently engaged  parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app, respectively),  fully engaged  (26/214, 12.1%),  partially engaged  (32/214, 15%), and  unengaged  (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married parents were more likely to be  fully engaged  than  independently engaged  ( P =.02) or  unengaged  ( P =.01) users.  Socially engaged  parents were older than  fully engaged  ( P =.02) and  unengaged  ( P =.01) parents.

Fully engaged  children were younger than  dabblers  ( P =.04) and  unengaged  ( P= .003) children.  Dabblers  lived in higher-income households than  fully  and  partially engaged  children ( P =.03 and  P =.047, respectively).  Fully engaged  children were more likely to have  fully engaged  ( P <.001) and  partially engaged  ( P <.001) parents than  unengaged  children. Compared with  unengaged  children,  fully  and  partially engaged  children had decreased total sugar ( P =.006 and  P =.004, respectively) and energy intake ( P =.03 and  P =.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use.  Partially engaged  children also had decreased sugary beverage intake compared with  unengaged  children ( P =.03). Similarly, children with  fully engaged  parents had decreased  z BMI, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased  z BMI over time ( P =.005). Finally, children with  independently engaged  parents had decreased caloric intake, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased caloric intake over time ( P =.02). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Full parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions.

    "document": "Physical exercise as a tool to help the immune system against COVID-19: an integrative review of the current literature\nAcute viral respiratory infections are the main infectious disease in the world. In 2020, a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global pandemic. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as genetics, age and physical state, and its main input receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases. Thus, regular practice of adequate intensity is suggested as an auxiliary tool in strengthening and preparing the immune system for COVID-19. Further studies are needed to associate physical exercise with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "document": "Sucrose uptake by pinocytosis in Amoeba proteus and the influence of external calcium\nThe relationship between Ca++ and pinocytosis was investigated in Amoeba proteus. Pinocytosis was induced with 0.01% alcian blue, a large molecular weight dye which binds irreversibly to the cell surface. The time-course and intensity of pinocytosis was monitored by following the uptake of [3H]SUCROSE. When the cells are exposed to 0.01% alcian blue, there is an immediate uptake of sucrose. The cells take up integral of 10% of their initial volume during the time-course of pinocytosis. The duration of pinocytosis in the amoeba is integral of 50 min, with maximum sucrose uptake occurring 15 min after the induction of pinocytosis. The pinocytotic uptake of sucrose is reversibly blocked at 3 degrees C and a decrease in pH increases the uptake of sucrose by pinocytosis. The process of pinocytosis is also dependent upon the concentration of the inducer in the external medium. The association between Ca++ and pinocytosis in A. proteus was investigated initially by determining the effect of the external Ca++ concentration on sucrose uptake induced by alcian blue. In Ca++-free medium, no sucrose uptake is observed in the presence of 0.01% alcian blue. As the Ca++ concentration is increased, up to a maximum of 0.1 mM, pinocytotic sucrose uptake is also increased. Increases in the external Ca++ concentration above 0.1 mM brings about a decrease in sucrose uptake. Further investigations into the association between Ca++ and pinocytosis demonstrated that the inducer of pinocytosis displaces surface calcium in the amoeba. It is suggested that Ca++ is involved in two separate stages in the process of pinocytosis; an initial displacement of surface calcium by the inducer which may increase the permeability of the membrane to solutes and a subsequent Ca++ influx bringing about localized increases in cytoplasmic Ca++ ion activity.",

The study used an interactive survey to gather data; GJH was assessed using a cut-off Beighton score of \u22655 in accordance with the 2017 International Classification of EDS criteria. The analyzed sample consisted of 482 female and 172 male participants from Florida Gulf Coast University (USA). The prevalence of GJH in a university-aged population can be estimated at 12.5%. Women did not have higher rates of GJH than men. However, female participants showed significantly higher rates of hypermobility of the spine as well as the right knee and elbow joints. The Beighton scores did not differ by ethnicity/race. Female participants had a lower rate of self-reported injuries than male participants, although this difference was not significant. There was no difference in the proportion of all participants classified within different categories (0; 1\u20134; 5\u20139) of Beighton scores and whether or not they reported having been injured. Male and female participants reported chronic pain of joints and neck or back at the same rates across the Beighton score categories.

    "document": "Pelvic Congestion Syndrome\nPatients with pelvic congestion syndrome present with otherwise unexplained chronic pelvic pain that has been present for greater than 6 months, and anatomic findings that include pelvic venous insufficiency and pelvic varicosities. It remains an underdiagnosed explanation for pelvic pain in young, premenopausal, usually multiparous females. Symptoms include noncyclical, positional lower back, pelvic and upper thigh pain, dyspareunia, and prolonged postcoital discomfort. Symptoms worsen throughout the day and are exacerbated by activity or prolonged standing. Examination may reveal ovarian tenderness and unusual varicosities\u2014vulvoperineal, posterior thigh, and gluteal. Diagnosis is suspected by clinical history and imaging that demonstrates pelvic varicosities. Venography is usually necessary to confirm ovarian vein reflux, although transvaginal ultrasound may be useful in documenting this finding. Endovascular therapy has been validated by several large patient series with long-term follow-up using standardized pain assessment surveys. Embolization has been shown to be significantly more effective than surgical therapy in improving symptoms in patients who fail hormonal therapy. Although there has been variation in approaches between investigators, the goal is elimination of ovarian vein reflux with or without direct sclerosis of enlarged pelvic varicosities. Symptom reduction is seen in 70 to 90% of the treated females despite technical variation.",
    "response": "What I'd take from that MRI report is that you have the *bare* minimum necessary to diagnose adenomyosis (which is 12 mm focal thickening of the junctional zone, but without any other more specific features), a condition that is commonly-enough seen in asymptomatic patients by ultrasound and MRI that it usually doesn't even make it to the impression of the report (but in this case the radiologist didn't have anything else to talk about). \n\n[This paper]( is a few years old, but I'm not sure there's anything more recent that specifically adresses (isolated) adenomyosis and deep dyspareunia:\n\n> Endometriosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and interstitial cystitis have been associated with deep dyspareunia. Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life. Deep dyspareunia related to the presence of pelvic congestion syndrome should be treated by pelvic vein embolization. Intravesical therapy may be effective in treating deep dyspareunia in women with interstitial cystitis. It remains unclear **whether** uterine myomas and **adenomyosis are causes of deep dyspareunia**.\n\nDiscussed [here]( (a PDF of the entire article is available; its actually really good and only a few pages) is that hormonal treatment *is* a mainstay in treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis. \n\nSo it's possible that your gyn is concluding that since you don't have anything but a minimal and likely incidental 'diagnosis' of adenomyosis, and since BC seems to do a very good job with your periods in general but does nothing to your main symptom, that it is unlikely (but not impossibly) to be related."

The urologist says it's bacterial or fungal, but there's no way to know for sure. He prescribed nystatin cream again and also bactrim.  I'm to take both simultaneously. The dermatologist says it's neither fungal nor bacterial nor viral, it's just \"irritation that comes with age because the skin disintegrates as you get older\" and that I need to get circumcised, he has a friend who does it, and that he sees 5+ patients a day with this issue, and it's never fungal or bacterial. I find what the dermatologist said to be quite odd and I certainly don't want to chop off my foreskin. All say that there's no test to determine what the cause is. I find it so difficult to believe that in 2021 we can't solve this. My father is 92 years old, fought in Korea where he didn't shower or bathe for months, and he's never had this issue. One of my exgirlfriends (4 to 8+ years ago) used to have odd discharge that she had her OBGYN test for using a swab of some sort. She got it all fixed in a month or two and it would come back once a year or so but she'd get it fixed pretty quickly each time. Not sure what it was, don't recall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions:\n\nWhat do you think the issue is based on what I've written and the image I posted?\n\nIs there a definitive test (culture test or something similar?) to know what's going on?\n\nIs there anywhere I can go to get this tested and treated in NYC?\n\nWhat course of treatment would you recommend if you had me walk into your office?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance...",
    "document": "Monitoring occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in school populations: A wastewater-based approach\nClinical testing of children in schools is challenging, with economic implications limiting its frequent use as a monitoring tool of the risks assumed by children and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, a wastewater-based epidemiology approach has been used to monitor 16 schools (10 primary, 5 secondary and 1 post-16 and further education) in England. A total of 296 samples over 9 weeks have been analysed for N1 and E genes using qPCR methods. Of the samples returned, 47.3% were positive for one or both genes with a detection frequency in line with the respective local community. WBE offers a low cost, non-invasive approach for supplementing clinical testing and can provide longitudinal insights that are impractical with traditional clinical testing.",
    "response": "It could be contact dermatitis - meaning that your foreskin is allergic to something in the environment. It could be an irritation response to heat, friction, etc. It doesn't sound or appear (I only was able to pull up the 2nd photo) to be infectious. You can always do a skin biopsy but likely it'll be low-yield, meaning it won't tell you much. \n\nTreatment ... that's not easy ... I'd want to ask more questions, review your diet, etc. I don't think it's hygiene frankly. Though, if you don't shower as much then you'll build up more fungal organisms which aren't bad, in fact, they might be protective in many ways. But if you are used to washing with pretty harsh soaps as most people are, then you'll like go through a cycle of eliminating all the good bugs and then building them back up.\n\nI'd start dousing your penis with coconut oil, avoid using a harsh soap for a while, don't rub the skin hard, let it heal for a few weeks and months and I have a feeling you'll be done with this and it won't come back."

A patient with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of BCP who was successfully treated with topical mupirocin ointment is described. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             The PubMed database was searched with the key words: bactroban, balanitis, cell, circumscripta, mupirocin, plasma, plasmacellularis, tacrolimus, Zoon. The papers generated by the search and their references were reviewed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Treatments for BCP have previously included circumcision and topical calcineurin inhibitors.

We confirm an earlier observation demonstrating successful management of this condition with topical mupirocin 2% ointment. Previously reported therapies include circumcision, topical calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, and laser therapy. However, based on our observations, topical mupirocin 2% ointment therapy may be considered for the initial management of patients with suspected BCP. Prompt response to mupirocin 2% ointment is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of BCP since morphologically similar skin conditions do not respond to this treatment.",

Participants in the present study were 65 years or older with a diagnosis of cataract in the linked Medicare claims database. The WHI data were collected from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed for the present study from July 1, 2014, through September 1, 2017. \n           \n           \n             Exposures \n             Cataract surgery as determined by Medicare claims codes. \n           \n           \n             Main Outcomes and Measures \n             The outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality and mortality attributed to vascular, cancer, accidental, neurologic, pulmonary, and infectious causes. Mortality rates were compared by cataract surgery status using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for demographics, systemic and ocular comorbidities, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and physical activity. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             A total of 74\u2009044 women with cataract in the WHI included 41\u2009735 who underwent cataract surgery. Mean (SD) age was 70.5 (4.6) years; the most common ethnicity was white (64\u2009430 [87.0%]), followed by black (5293 [7.1%]) and Hispanic (1723 [2.3%]). The mortality rate was 2.56 per 100 person-years in both groups. In covariate-adjusted Cox models, cataract surgery was associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR],\u20090.40; 95% CI, 0.39-0.42) as well as lower mortality specific to vascular (AHR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.39-0.46), cancer (AHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.29-0.34), accidental (AHR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58), neurologic (AHR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.53), pulmonary (AHR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.78), and infectious (AHR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36-0.54) diseases. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions and Relevance \n             In older women with cataract in the WHI, cataract surgery is associated with lower risk for total and cause-specific mortality, although whether this association is explained by the intervention of cataract surgery is unclear. Further study of the interplay of cataract surgery, systemic disease, and disease-related mortality would be informative for improved patient care.",

I've been writing this for almost 5 hours now, so I might also be going slightly insane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore you run away from this huge wall of text, please listen to me for a few minutes. Okay? Okay. I'm a desperate young girl who loved playing the piano, drawing and playing video games, and now can do none of those due to nerve damage and joint pain that can't be explained, among other weird and possibly connected symptoms. I know this has a lot of information, and I am not asking you to read all of it. I'm asking you to look through the bold titles and see if one of them sounds like something you would know a thing or two about.\n\nSo yeah, possible problems for you to solve include\n\n* Why am I semi immune to sedatives, caffeine and alcohol\n* Why is there something wrong with every limb of me\n* Is there an autoimmune disease that could be causing all of this\n\nThe reason I included all of this: every time I go to a doctor, there is something I forget to mention, can't mention because it's not their specialty or am just too embarrased to list all these weird symptoms, but a lot of them have proven to be important.\n\nI will be crossposting this to r/DiagnoseMe and r/medical  so sorry for anyone that has to see it multiple times. After every section with meaningful information I've included a small TLDR just because eeehhhh this is quite a bit of text. If you've read even this far, I am so greatful for you. Thank you.\n\n**INFORMATION ABOUT ME:** I'm a caucasian, 17 year old female from Finland. I am 158 cm/ 5'2\" tall and weigh around 70 kg/154 lb. Financially we are struggling, but we can afford the public healthcare just fine. Rarely drink alcohol, no other usuage of drugs etc. If you asked my doctor about my medical condition, she would take a long pause and then say she doesn't really know the whole picture, but something is definitely wrong.Looking at family background, my mother's side has a lot type 1 diabetes and while I don't know a lot about my father's side, I know all of his siblings and their children have ADHD and asperger's while I seem to have neither. I'm currently on birth control pills and medication for depression, both for 2-3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:** During the past couple of years I've been getting more and more unexplainable symptoms. They are all over the place, concerning at least my nerves and joints, but most likely also my blood, bones, autoimmune system, brain and digestive system. They started getting aggressively worse 7-8 months ago, and ever since that I've had regular visits with my local doctor, regular blood work checkups, an ultrasound, thoracic (lung) radiographies and most recently a few days ago, a bone marrow biopsy. The only real progress we've made is with my bloodwork, constantly showing the same abnormalities specified later.\\^ TLDR: Multiple different symptoms have been bothering me for years, getting worse 8 months ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINLAND AND DOCTORS:** Finland is a great country to live in, don't get me wrong. I know there are multiple countries and multiple people who have an even worse situation and I'm not trying to say otherwise. However I live in an extremely small town, which has it's good and bad sides. I can get 45 minutes of time from my local doctor almost any day I need it, and all the staff at our local clinic knows my situation and does their best to help me.\n\nIt's just that they can't do a lot. Once a month or so they take some blood and every monday it's sent off to the bigger city. My doctor can monitor my symptoms but after that all she can do is send me to another doctor which will take months, and since my symptoms are so episodic, this can turn out to be problematic. Private clinics would have times in weeks if not days, but we can't really afford that.\\^ TLDR: Finland is good, just a bit slow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROBLEMS STARTING IN CHILDHOOD:** I was an extremely clumsy child. Not in a cute way, in a way where I would break all of my teeth and constantly have bruises just from carefully playing. I have never broken a bone or really gotten seriously injured, since I have always been extremely careful to a point where I have missed out on a lot of things because of it. I think it's mostly a mix of me having terrible balance and a lacking depth perception. Also, extremely low pain tolerance.\\^ TLDR: Bad balance and depth perception.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GROWING UP:** I was a really tall child, having rapid growth burts. This would also cause my spine to go real roller coastery real fast. I had pretty severe scoliosis, and after I turned 9 and moved to a bigger school with actual healthcare they started ping ponging me to the big hospital and back, deciding if something should be done about it or not. When I turned 11, I had a huge growth burst of 8 cm/ 3.1\", and after that, I literally stopped growing. Less than one cm in 6 years after that, sooo my roller coaster spine was left alone and didn't really bother me then. Yeah, now it does.\n\nThen a weird thing. It turned out I was actually missing most of baby or adult teeth, depending on how you look at it I guess. I only shed my upper central incisors, one upper canine and one lower canine. The upper ones grew primary teeth, but it turned out there just wasn't any developement for primary teeth elsewhere in my mouth. While researching the correct terms I figured it's actually not that rare to have this with 1 or 2 teeth, but almost all of them? Yikes. Also, my dentists had never seen it and were extremely confused.\\^ TLDR: My spine and teeth hate their lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MIDPOINT NOTES:** With these more \"normal\" things out of the way, let's dive deeper. Yeah, that's just the beginning.\n\nI had to choose what flair to use, since my problems fall under several of them. This also made me think if I should go through my problem as a timeline or as groups, and ended up with the group approach. I will try to make it clear when everything happened and might end up making an actual timeline drawing at some point, maybe it will help me too.\n\nFrom this point forward, I have no actual way of telling what is connected and what is just coinsidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BLOOD WORK:** Let's start with the simple things, my blood work. I now noticed they're not as regularly taken as I remember, but that's fine. There are three main things my doctors are worried about, and that have been kept track of because of that. The problem is, in Finland we have completely different names for them, but I tried my best with google. There's C-reactive protein (P-CRP), Lymphocyte (B-leuk) and thrombocyte (B-Trom). My mother recalls her sister had high thrombocyte levels growing up, but we're not sure. Anyway, I made a fast obnoxiously colored chart with all the \"important\" blood work available [here]( as blood work 1 and blood work 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NERVES:** The first really serious symptom I had was nerve damage. Around the spring of 2017 I started having pain in my left elbow, that radiated through my wrist to my fingers. It got worse on the daily until one day I just woke up with absolutely no feeling on the outer side of my hand. My pinkie was completely numb, ring finger partually. The outer part of my palm under the fingers had reduced feeling. Since this explanation is kind of clumsy, in the previous imgur also available [here]( is an image (nerves 1).\n\nWhen the summer holiday ended, I finally got a doctor's appointment and immediately got sent to a childrens hand and nerve specialist. After about 7 months of living in constant level 4-5 pain, I finally got an appointment with a doctor who could actually help me. She immediately scheluded surgery in January without any diagnosis or further tests. Yes, she said it's most likely nerve compression, but nothing more official.\n\nSo the surgery comes and when I wake up, I actually do feel my hand and the constant pain is gone. The surgery was supposed to take about an hour, but ended up taking almost 5 and I never got a proper explanation as of to why, apart from that she had to cut/grind/whet/whatever term is correct for smoothing off a part of my bone. Recovery went fine, but after the pain killers wore off, the pain came back. Now it wasn't constant 4, it was occasional 5 or 6. The hand is still pretty much useless: It has no muscle mass and a lot of everyday tasks hurt, but I'm used to it now. The worst part is, after the surgery if anything touches the spot on my elbow pictured on nerves 2, it's literally the worst pain I can imagine. Sometimes the similar pain happens when I just straighten out the arm. If the bone marrow biopsy was level 7 pain, I would completely honestly say that touching my elbow is worse. I've heard 8 is the pain level of child birth, so I really don't want to go that high, but it feels like it. Reminder, I have very low pain tolerance, and even hugging often hurts.\n\nUnfortunately about 6 months later similar symptoms started in my right arm. Until this day it still hasn't done the complete numbness-trick, but is constantly hurting, has no muscle mass and just kind of hangs around. I've had to take multiple hour long breaks during writing this just because my fingers will stop functioning.\n\nThat's another thing. Along with the pain, the nerve damage has caused my fingers to not function too well. I literally can't control my ring finger on it's own, it will just follow my pinky that also is hard to control. Due to the lack of muscle mass, holding things is already difficult, but add on to that 2/5 fingers just doing whatever they please, and it's pretty annoying to be honest.\\^ TLDR: My both hands have nerve damage, most likely ulnar nerve compression caused by one bone being too large.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BACK AND LUNGS:** The scoliosis has started creeping up on me. To put it lightly, I'm skewed. Lopsided. Crooked. Not straight at all. Funnily enough, you can mostly notice this when I have a ponytail: My head is always so much tilted/skewed to the left that the ponytail is also always hanging on my shoulder. This has led to a situation where my upper neck and lower back are both extremely painful. Compared to the hand pain, it's a different pain. While nerve bain is stabbing and radiating, the back pain is just a constant weight that slowly makes it harder and harder to breathe.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't hurt my back is lying down. This might explain some of my extra weight: Even sitting is painful. I work very hard to keep myself out of bed, but for example in school I have to take a a break once every hour to go to the bathroom just to lie on the floor. Unhygienic for sure, but also the greatest relief ever.\\^ TLDR: If I sit or stand, by back will start hurting in about 20 minutes so bad I feel like I can't breathe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**START OF \"EPISODES\"**: About 7 months ago I got a pretty mild case of angina or tonsillitis. Nothing major, got it from my mom who works in a daycare, went with her to get antibiotics from our local clinic.\n\nUntil this day, our best guess is that this started it all. We don't know how, or why, but after this disease most of my absolutely unexplainable symptoms started. What do I mean by unexplainable? Well.\n\nAfter I got the antibiotics for the angina, everything was fine for about a week until the treatment ended. A few days before that I had what we then assumed was a yeart infection. I had never had one before, my doctor said the symptoms checked out and I got treated for that. The symptoms didn't go away as soon as  they should've, but maybe in \\~10 days. I was kind of busy with the section below so it went unnoticed.\n\n**JOINTS:** Just days after the yeast infection I noticed some weird rashes on my elbows. Also, surprisingly included in the mega bomb of pictures [here]( are the two pictures of my elbows. The rash was mostly red dots, not painful or itchy unless you touched it. One of them developed some yellow in the center. It was symmetric all along my body, starting in elbows, then showing up in knees and ankles. Always on both sides at the same time. This on it's own wouldn't be too concerning, but the next day all of the spots with rash were also extremely swollen, hot, red and painful. I could barely walk. That's when the first blood test with the highest infection count was taken, and when it passed in a few days before I could get to someone who knows about rashes or joints, we just ruled it as some kind of joint infection most likely caused by some autoimmune reaction.\n\nIt has happened 3 times since, every single time being extremely painful, scary and going away within a week. However we have found no actual explanation for it. My doctor said they tested for Rheumatoid arthritis, but can't rule it out.\\^TLDR: After getting angina, I started having episodes where my autoimmune system seems to attack itself, causing mostly joint centered problems.\n\n**\"IN MY HEAD\"/MENTAL SYMPTOMS:** There are multiple symptoms that affect me mentally, the strongest one being tiredness. Always during these \"episodes\" and sometimes outside of them, I'm so tired I will fall asleep sitting on the bus even if I slept a normal amount before it. I will just sleep and sleep and sleep, no matter what I do. I just actually can't stay awake. I usually have a slight fever, but nothing to be worried about. At a point I was admitted to the hospital because I literally slept 23 hours and didn't wake up even when I wet myself, which I have never done after being a toddler. After sleeping there for another 18 hours I woke up slightly less tired and was finally sent home with no answers.\n\nIn the past few months I've also started stuttering and having brain fog. If I'm actively in a conversation, I will stutter once every 2-5 minutes, and sometimes I will stutter the same word closer to 10 times before finally getting over it. I never before have stuttered at all, so this is weird and annoying.\n\nWith the brain fog, it seems to be mostly when I get up and start moving after being inactive for a while. For example in the morning when I leave for school, or when I after class get up. It's not every time and is always not related to activity, but just thought I'd point it out. I feel like my head is just... not functioning properly. Everything feels extremely slow and fast at the same time and for the first time in my life, I've experienced trouble focusing. Sometimes I also experience blurry vision or dizzyness at the same time, but not sure if there is a connection or not.\n\nI have yet to talk about these to any doctor, just my school nurse, who didn't seem too concerned. However to me, they are really just hard to deal with.\\^TLDR: My head is sometimes foggy, dizzy and almost always tired.\n\n**DIGESTIVE SYSTEM:** In the past few years eating has become sort of difficult. I usually eat a light breakfast around 6, then either in school at 12 or when I get home at 15. Sometimes I will eat a heavier meal in the evening, sometimes another light one like bread. I have always functioned like this, and most days I'm fine like that.\n\nHowever these changes have made it so I can't really eat. In school I'm more often hungry, but when I go to eat I will feel full after literally eating a few bites. Some days it will be even worse, and when I get home I will again be really hungry but unable to eat without feeling sick. More often than not I can still eat a normal amount for me, but I really hate the days when my stomach just decides it doesn't want food.\n\nI've had some weeks where I often throw up for no explanation, but I can also keep some food down and don't feel otherwise sick.\n\nOn a more unpleasent note, I've also been suffering with constipation a lot. I've always been kind of a seldom pooper, maybe 1-2 times a week. However this autumn I had a 2 month period where I pooped twice. I tried taking stool softeners and laxatives but there was literally no effect, until my doctor gave me a stronger one that worked after about a week. After that it's been a bit rarer than usual, maybe once every two weeks, but luckily not as bad. The stool is actually not even all that hard, big or painful, it just feels like it doesn't really move all that fast while in there.\\^TLDR: I can't eat normal portion sizes most days. Also had bad constipation.\n\n**TOLERANCE/LOW EFFECTIVENESS:** Another thing that might or might not be related to the digestive system. I have a high tolerance for many substances. Actually I'm not really sure if it's as much high tolerance as it's just that they take a very long time to effect, if they do at all. While \"substances\" sounds rather illegal, I'm actually talking about sedatives and caffeine. Because I'm so sensitive to pain, I often get sedatives before dentists or in this example, the bone marrow biopsy. During the first 3 times I got it at the dentists, I got it 30 minutes before as recommended, since it should start effecting you in about 20 minutes. However it actually started effecting me once I got home, almost 1,5 hours later. Last time I got a slightly stronger sedative an hour before and it worked much better.\n\nWhen it comes to caffeine, I don't have this scientific amounts to give, but it has never really affected me in any way. While my mom has always started feeling bad after just half a cup of coffee or an energy drink, neither affect me at all, even in bigger quantities. I have never drank more than 2 energy drinks at a time, but felt absolutely no difference.\n\nAnd then there's alcohol. I first started drinking alcohol about 6 months ago, in a safe environment in small quantities. When the 3rd time came around, I had still never even felt tipsy. My boyfriend weighs a noticeable amount more than me, and so do many other men there. They are all also more used to alcohol. I wanted to feel something, so I started drinking shots with one of them. He's older than me, bigger than me and more used to alcohol, being one of the biggest drinkers there. I outdrank him and while I felt slightly tipsy after that, he threw up.\n\nOn New years eve I decided to take a bit more, and was honestly shocked at home much I could drink without any problems. A lot of the guys that didn't know me were so sure that I'd throw up any minute and kept giving me shots, and but I was fine. The only \"drunk\" thing I did all night was forgetting my phone in the bedroom, which is rare for me. When we got home I started feeling slightly weird, but that was literally 6 hours after I stopped drinking.\n\nMy mom and everyone else is super confused about this, calling it my \"unuseful superpower\". Honestly it just bothers me. I hate feeling like there's something wrong with me. I would just like to add that I am still drinking responsibly and there's no need to worry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AUTOIMMUNE:** Everyone's best guess at this point is some kind of autoimmune disease that we just can't lock down, so we're trying to slowly rule out other possibilities. I just have a lot of symptoms that are kind of random but could definitely be explained by the body attacking itself, like constant fatigue and tiredness, muscle/joint/nerve pain and stiffness, slighty higher than normal hair loss and low fevers from time to time. One peculiar symptom is canker sores or mouth ulcers that always come at the same time as other symptoms, sometimes making my mouth hurt so bad I can't eat for days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:** I'm almost certain I missed something, and I will be editing and adding them in. I thank everyone that read even a small portion of this, even if you don't know what could be going on with me. I'm just honestly tired of this. I miss drawing, playing the piano and having a normal life.\n\nI'm going out of city for the weekend so I will be answering on mobile as best as I can, if I still remember the password for this account. Let's pray I can post in all the subs with negative karma, I'm at -2 at the moment for pissing off a videogame subreddit by suggesting some changes.\n\nI probably should've waited the few weeks until I get the results of the bone marrow test, but I'm too sick of living like this. Thank you to everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Yep, I forgot the password to this reddit account. Thank you to everyone that spend their time on reading and commenting. No results about the bone marrow yet.",
    "document": "Immune Suppression and Immune Activation in Depression\nDepression has been characterized as a disorder of both immune suppression and immune activation. Markers of impaired cellular immunity (decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity) and inflammation (elevated IL-6, TNF\u03b1, CRP) have been associated with depression. These immunological markers have been associated with other medical illnesses, suggesting that immune dysregulation may be a central feature common to both depression and to its frequent medical comorbidities. Yet the significant associations of findings of both immune suppression and immune activation with depression raise questions concerning the relationship between these two classes of immunological observations. Depressed populations are heterogeneous groups, and there may be differences in the immune profiles of populations that are more narrowly defined in terms of symptom profile and/or demographic features. \n           There have been few reports concurrently investigating markers of immune suppression and immune activation in the same depressed individuals. An emerging preclinical literature suggests that chronic inflammation may directly contribute to the pathophysiology of immune suppression in the context of illnesses such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This literature provides us with specific immunoregulatory mechanisms mediating these relationships that could also explain differences in immune disturbances between subsets of depressed individuals We propose a research agenda emphasizing the assessment of these immunoregulatory mechanisms in large samples of depressed subjects as a means to define the relationships among immune findings (suppression and/or activation) within the same depressed individuals and to characterize subsets of depressed subjects based on shared immune profiles. Such a program of research, building on and integrating our knowledge of the psychoneuroimmunology of depression, could lead to innovation in the assessment and treatment of depression and its medical comorbidities.",

Last April I finished up my second round of accutane (actually I stopped 1 month early because I couldn\u2019t tolerate the pain anymore) and I wish I could take it back. While on accutane I had every side effect that you could possibly have with that drug. I do not wish this kind of pain upon ANYONE. Here I am 1 year later and I\u2019m STILL in pain. I\u2019m active, very active. I work out 5 days a week and I\u2019m an auto mechanic. My main problems are in my elbows, my shoulders, and my lower back (sometimes my hips and my knees will flare up) but my shoulder, elbow, lower back pains usually remains constant. Usually mornings it seems worse, I feel stiff, and within a few hours the pain does lessen (but always still lingers). Also I notice that if I break diet a little bit and eat shitty food like pizza, or sugary things or have a night out of drinking, my whole body aches. I have a very healthy diet. because I struggled with acne, I cut dairy from my diet. It sucks because it makes me depressed because working out/lifting is my passion and I really want to do a body building show but I feel as if the pain I\u2019ve been dealing with is really holding me back from doing so. Could accutane have caused something that\u2019s given me this permanent damage? I\u2019ve NEVER had issues like this and I feel so brittle like I have to modify almost anything I do in the gym just to alleviate some type of pain. I\u2019ve read online that other people have had similar experiences post accutane, I\u2019ve even read some articles/ studies linking accutane with arthritis? Also I forgot to mention I have told my primary care doctor about this, and she\u2019s done blood work but says that there was nothing of concern but I find it hard to believe.

    "document": "Temporal changes in gene expression in the skin of patients treated with isotretinoin provide insight into its mechanism of action\nIsotretinoin (13- cis  RA) is the most potent agent in the treatment of acne. Insights into its mechanism of action can lead to drug discovery of alternative compounds with comparable efficacy but improved safety. The goal of this study is to compare the temporal changes in gene expression in the skin of acne patients after 1 week and 8 weeks of treatment with isotretinoin. Microarray analysis was performed on skin biopsies taken from eight acne patients prior to and at 8 weeks of treatment with isotretinoin. Results were compared with data obtained from seven acne patients biopsied at one week of treatment in a prior study. Distinctly different patterns of gene expression were noted. At 8 weeks, genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins were upregulated and numerous genes encoding lipid metabolizing enzymes were downregulated. At 1 week, genes encoding differentiation markers, tumor suppressors and serine proteases were upregulated. Only three genes were commonly downregulated. The temporal changes in gene expression in patient skin noted with isotretinoin substantiate many previously reported effects of isotretinoin and other retinoids, suggesting a model wherein isotretinoin induces apoptosis leading to reduced sebaceous gland size, decreased expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes and increased matrix remodeling during acne resolution.",

I thought that was that but the next week it came back with avengeance and was vomiting as well as the water diarrhea. which is what i had put all this down too-the food not re heated properly.\n\ni have had this 7 times since feb (the last 4 times have all been a few weeks from each other)and a doc has said Diverticula which i don't think it is.

Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI  z  scores ( z BMI), diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified:  socially engaged  (35/214, 16.3%),  independently engaged  (18/214, 8.4%) ( socially  and  independently engaged  parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app, respectively),  fully engaged  (26/214, 12.1%),  partially engaged  (32/214, 15%), and  unengaged  (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married parents were more likely to be  fully engaged  than  independently engaged  ( P =.02) or  unengaged  ( P =.01) users.  Socially engaged  parents were older than  fully engaged  ( P =.02) and  unengaged  ( P =.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes among children:  fully engaged  (32/214, 15%),  partially engaged  (61/214, 28.5%),  dabblers  (42/214, 19.6%), and  unengaged  (79/214, 36.9%) users.

Fully engaged  children were more likely to have  fully engaged  ( P <.001) and  partially engaged  ( P <.001) parents than  unengaged  children. Compared with  unengaged  children,  fully  and  partially engaged  children had decreased total sugar ( P =.006 and  P =.004, respectively) and energy intake ( P =.03 and  P =.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use.  Partially engaged  children also had decreased sugary beverage intake compared with  unengaged  children ( P =.03). Similarly, children with  fully engaged  parents had decreased  z BMI, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased  z BMI over time ( P =.005).

    "question": "Hi! So I recently started training in contortion (5 months ago). I've practiced nearly every day. Last Tuesday, I got a very loud buzzing sound in my right ear. I thought a huge bee somehow got inside my head, it was that loud. About 20 minutes later, it happened again. But I had earplugs in, the second time, so I knew it wasn't a bug. This was around 8pm that day. I did two things earlier that day, that I'm not sure had anything to do with it:\n\n1. Around 12pm, I watched this Andrew Huberman video about increasing your range of motion by increasing your range of vision. I think I might have misunderstood it? But I was practicing my splits and instead of keeping my head facing forward, I turned around as far as I could and physically pushed my eyes to look as far as I could behind me. Sorry if that sounds so idiotic haha I'm sure I misunderstood what he was saying, but anyway that's what I did. I felt my eyes straining. I held it for about 60 seconds on each side. \n\n2. I met with my contortion coach online at 1pm. We worked on backbends (and neck and shoulder warmups) for the whole hour. I specifically asked her to help me with my neck placement because I could finally see my feet, while in a backbend position.  So we practiced a lot of \"elongating\" neck movements, up and down. I felt really good after class. \n\nSo when I got that buzz (hours later) and looked it up, people said it sounded like tinnitus. But it was hours after practicing. I emailed my coach to ask her (she is a doctor of physical therapy) and her first thought was that it could be from a fall or something to do with chewing? She said she didn't think it had anything to do with backbends. \n\nBut I didn't practice at all anyway, since last Tuesday. And today I practiced again... did some backbends, but only like 3. And I got that same really loud buzz in my right ear again (and hours later again). \n\nI'm freaking out because online it says that could be from a neck or head injury, but I just moved so I don't have health insurance yet :( \n\n\n(Last Wednesday night, my right eye was bouncing a lot after I laid down to go to bed, too). That was the only time that happened, but wasn't sure if they were connected. That's why I mentioned the video I watched about range of vision. I'm wondering if I actually injured myself from doing that, since my coach doesn't think it's from backbending? \n\nI'm just not sure if I should freak out or not because Google says tinnitus in one ear is cause for concern but I can't go to a doc for weeks :( if anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate it so much!!!

    "document": "Vestibular paroxysmia: a treatable neurovascular cross-compression syndrome\nThe leading symptoms of vestibular paroxysmia (VP) are recurrent, spontaneous, short attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo that generally last less than one minute and occur in a series of up to 30 or more per day. VP may manifest when arteries in the cerebellar pontine angle cause a segmental, pressure-induced dysfunction of the eighth nerve. The symptoms are usually triggered by direct pulsatile compression with ephaptic discharges, less often by conduction blocks. MR imaging reveals the neurovascular compression of the eighth nerve (3D constructive interference in steady state and 3D time-of-flight sequences) in more than 95\u00a0% of cases. A loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery seems to be most often involved, less so the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, the vertebral artery, or a vein. The frequent attacks of vertigo respond to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, even in low dosages (200\u2013600\u00a0mg/d or 300\u2013900\u00a0mg/d, respectively), which have been shown to also be effective in children. Alternative drugs to try are lamotrigine, phenytoin, gabapentin, topiramate or baclofen or other non-antiepileptic drugs used in trigeminal neuralgia. The results of ongoing randomized placebo-controlled treatment studies, however, are not yet available. Surgical microvascular decompression of the eighth nerve is the \u201cultima ratio\u201d for medically intractable cases or in exceptional cases of non-vascular compression of the eighth nerve by a tumor or cyst.

    "document": "Comprehensive metabolomic characterization of atrial fibrillation\nBackground \n             Using human humoral metabolomic profiling, we can discover the diagnostic biomarkers and pathogenesis of disease. The specific characterization of atrial fibrillation (AF) subtypes with metabolomics may facilitate effective and targeted treatment, especially in early stages. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             By investigating disturbed metabolic pathways, we could evaluate the diagnostic value of biomarkers based on metabolomics for different types of AF. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A cohort of 363 patients was enrolled and divided into a discovery and validation set. Patients underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) for suspected AF. Groups were divided as follows: healthy individuals (Control), suspected AF (Sus-AF), first diagnosed AF (Fir-AF), paroxysmal AF (Par-AF), persistent AF (Per-AF), and AF causing a cardiogenic ischemic stroke (Car-AF). Serum metabolomic profiles were determined by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography\u2013quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Metabolomic variables were analyzed with clinical information to identify relevant diagnostic biomarkers. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The metabolic disorders were characterized by 16 cross-comparisons. We focused on comparing all of the types of AF (All-AFs) plus Car-AF vs. Control, All-AFs vs. Car-AF, Par-AF vs. Control, and Par-AF vs. Per-AF. Then, 117 and 94 metabolites were identified by GC/MS and LC-QTOF-MS, respectively. The essential altered metabolic pathways during AF progression included D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, etc. For differential diagnosis, the area under the curve (AUC) of specific metabolomic biomarkers ranged from 0.8237 to 0.9890 during the discovery phase, and the predictive values in the validation cohort were 78.8\u201390.2%. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Serum metabolomics is a powerful way to identify metabolic disturbances. Differences in small\u2013molecule metabolites may serve as biomarkers for AF onset, progression, and differential diagnosis.",

This is due to indistinguishable characters of females and the lack of male specimens found. Consequently, the species  C. ornata  is the most commonly found species worldwide and the only species of the genus reported in South Africa. In the present study, we found  Cosmocerca  in three different amphibian species, namely  Cacosternum boettgeri ,  Kassina senegalensis  and  Phrynomantis bifasciatus . Based on differences in the shape of the gubernaculum and number of papillae, the found nematodes were assigned to three new species namely  C. \n daly  n. sp.,  C. monicae  n. sp. and  C. makhadoensis  n. sp. Descriptions of species are followed by pairwise and phylogenetic analysis of partial ITS-28S sequences. All three species were found only in their host types from distant localities. Therefore, we hypothesise that host specificity of  Cosmocerca  from South African amphibians might be rather high and that the presence of  C. ornata  throughout South Africa is rather doubtful.",

    "document": "Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Cordyceps militaris and their hypolipidemic effects in high fat diet fed mice\u2020\nCordyceps militaris  is a crude dietary therapeutic mushroom with high nutritional and medicinal values. Mushroom-derived polysaccharides have been found to possess antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities. This study aimed to partially clarify the structural characterization and comparatively evaluate hypolipidemic potentials of intracellular- (IPCM) and extracellular polysaccharides of  C. militaris  (EPCM) in high fat diet fed mice. Results indicated that IPCM-2 is \u03b1-pyran polysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 32.5 kDa, was mainly composed of mannose, glucose and galactose with mass percentages of 51.94%, 10.54%, and 37.25%, respectively. EPCM-2 is an \u03b1-pyran polysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 20 kDa that is mainly composed of mannose, glucose and galactose with mass percentages of 44.51%, 18.33%, and 35.38%, respectively. In  in vivo  study, EPCM-1 treatment (100 mg kg \u22121  d \u22121 ) showed potential effects on improving serum lipid profiles of hyperlipidemic mice, reflected by decreasing serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 20.05%, 45.45% and 52.63%, respectively, while IPCM-1 treatment (100 mg kg \u22121  d \u22121 ) remarkably decreased TC, TG and LDL-C levels by 20.74%, 47.93%, and 38.25%, respectively. In addition, EPCM-1 ameliorated hyperlipidemia possibly through upregulating the expression of serum lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and down-regulating the expression of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, while IPCM-1 remarkably upregulated the expression of serum LPL. This study confirms polysaccharides from  C. militaris  could be explored as functional foods or natural medicines for preventing hyperlipidemia. \n        \n           Structural characterization and comparative evaluation of hypolipidemic activities of intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides from  Cordyceps militaris .",

    "document": "SSRIs: Bad to the Bone?\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are globally popular antidepressants with broad clinical indications. Despite an overall favorable side-effect profile, our examination of 19 studies, one review, and one meta-analysis indicates that these unique antidepressants appear to have negative effects on bone, particularly with regard to bone mineral density and fracture risk. These risks may be enhanced by more serotonergic agents and/or longer exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The magnitude of this relationship is difficult to determine due to the myriad of potential confounds in available studies, but all indicate risk. In additional support of these findings, serotonin receptors have been identified on osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocyte cell lines, suggesting that serotonin may be an important regulatory agent in bone. While no formal recommendations regarding the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in risk populations are available, caution is advised in individuals with potential risk (i.e., those with osteoporosis or histories of osteoporotic fractures).",

    "document": "COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence\nCOVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide 1 , 2 . As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505) 3 . \n           However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors 4 . Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases 5 . Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases 6 . Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak 7 , 8 . \n           Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients\u2019 smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. \n           The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [\u2018smoking\u2019 OR \u2018tobacco\u2019 OR \u2018risk factors\u2019 OR \u2018smoker*\u2019] AND [\u2018COVID-19\u2019 OR \u2018COVID 19\u2019 OR \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov-2\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov 2\u2019] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). \n           Specifically, Zhou et al. 9  studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. \n           Similarly, Zhang et al. 10  presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65\u20137.63; p=0.2). \n           Huang et al. 11  studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. \n           The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al. 12  from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. \n           Finally, Liu et al. 13  found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58\u201325.00; p= 0.018). \n           We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12 . However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98\u20132.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43\u20134.04). \n           In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19. \n           \n             \n             \n               Table 1 \n               \n                 Overview of the five studies included in the systematic review \n               \n               \n                 \n                   \n                     \n                       Title \n                     \n                     \n                       Setting \n                     \n                     \n                       Population \n                     \n                     \n                       Study design and time horizon \n                     \n                     \n                       Outcomes \n                     \n                     \n                       Smoking rates by outcome \n                     \n                   \n                 \n                 \n                   \n                     Zhou et al. 9  (2020) Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study \n                     Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, China \n                     All adult inpatients (aged \u226518 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (191 patients) \n                     Retrospective multicenter cohort study until 31 January 2020 \n                     Mortality 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged \n                     Current smokers: n=11 (6%) Non-survivors: n=5 (9%) Survivors: n=6 (4%) (p=0.20) Current smoker vs non-smoker Univariate logistic regression (OR=2.23;

    "response": "It's not just one mechanism:\n\nFirstly, smoking disrupts your airway/lungs defense mechanism and thus makes you more susceptible to infections.\n\nSecondly, by smoking/vaping you have damaged/inflamed airways/lungs and therefore, if you get COVID, you simply don't have the breathing capacity that a healthy person does to tolerate the inflammation that comes with the viral infection. Hence, why you are more likely to go into respiratory failure and need to be ventilated, and possibly die.\n\nYou are definitely in the high risk group of complications/death from COVID.\n\n\" However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98\u20132.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43\u20134.04).\"\n\n ["

    "question": "Seems like an old person issue, right? \n\nOver the past 10 months I have had 6 rectal surgeries starting with 3 being drainage of a perineal abscess. 4&5 surgery were a partial fistulotomy (can't spell sorry) and 6th surgery was a rectal reconstruction where they took a patch of skin to cover up the distorted gaping hole in my rectum. \nHere I am, 4 months post 6th op, and in 1 day, I feel an abscess popping up again on the same spot. I am very familiar with this feeling, so I am certain that it is an abscess. \n\nI am very distraught and confused as to how this happened after my 6th op. I've been taking care of my digestive system, not once constipated. This has pretty much ruined my sanity, and I've lost almost all hope in this being resolved. I have no idea what is wrong with my body, and why it keeps occurring in the same spot. \n\nMy doc and I have ruled out chrones and IBS because we can pinpoint how this happened initially to an event. \n\nWhat else could this possibly be?? Why does it keep coming back after fistulotomies and reconstruction, and so many antibiotics?? We've exhausted all of the options I know of besides a colostomy bag (which is a last resort for me bc I'm 16 years old) \n If anyone has any suggestions for me it would be beyond appreciated. Entering my senior year of high school, I don't want to keep missing school and putting my life on hold for these abscesses. It's eating me alive mentally and I'm not sure what else to do.",
    "document": "Obesity is a negative predictor of success after surgery for complex anal fistula\nBackground \n             It was the aim of this study to compare the outcome of surgery for complex anal fistulas in obese and non-obese patients. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             All patients with complex anorectal fistulas who underwent fistulectomy and/or rectal advancement flap repair were prospectively recorded. Surgery was performed in a standardized technique. Body mass index (BMI [kg/m 2 ]) was used as objective measure to indicate morbid obesity. Patients with a BMI greater than 30 were defined as obese, and patients with a BMI below 30 were defined as non-obese. The parameters analyzed related to BMI included success or failure, and reoperation rate due to recurrent abscess. Success was defined as closure of both internal and external openings, absence of drainage without further intervention, and absence of abscess formation. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Within two years, 220 patients underwent advancement flap repair and met the inclusion criteria. 55% of patients were females, mean age was 39 (range 18-76) years, and the majority of fistulas were located at the posterior site. 69% of patients (152/220) were non-obese (BMI < 30), whereas 31% (68/220) were obese (BMI > 30). After a median follow-up of 6 months, primary healing rate (\"success\") for the whole collective was 82% (180/220). Success was significantly different between non-obese and obese patients: In non-obese patients, recurrence rate was significantly lower than in obese patients (14% vs. 28%; p < 0.01). Moreover, reoperation rate due to recurrent abscess with the need for seton drainage in the failure groups was significantly higher in obese patients when compared to non-obese patients (73% vs. 52%; p < 0.01). Using multivariate analysis, obesity was identified as independent predictive factor of success or failure (p < 0.02). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Obese patients are at higher risk for failure after surgery for complex anal fistula.",
    "response": "Kudos. \n\nThat is unfortunate. Since I only have a rudimentary understanding of the pathophysiology this was the only topic I saw neglected that I have the insight to mention. \n\nI do want to take the time to express how truly sorry I am that you are going through what you are. The cliche that is all too true is this too shall pass - you will best this one way or the other, especially so given your displayed mental fortitude.\n\nYou sound to be well taken care of physically in terms of your support system; however, I want to enforce how imperative mental health is to your holistic wellbeing. Seek the care of therapy or psychiatry (if you haven't) in order to gain healthy coping mechanisms and rule out biochemical stressors that make this ordeal even worse. Mental health in America is all too neglected and you make it obvious in your post that there are emotional symptoms that accompany this disease as well as the physical symptoms."

    "question": "Hello everyone.\n\nI am female, 28 years old, 165cm height, 58kg weight (sorry I only know metric). \n\nI have a weird question, for the past few years, I've been having these \"hallucinations\", i put them in quotations because I'm not sure if they are. Mostly when I'm feeling I'm about to fall asleep or when I've had my eyes closed for a long time or if I'm really tired, I keep seeing insects that aren't there. Mostly those big green grasshoppers or spiders, which I am kinda scared of. First thing that came to mind to me was sleep paralysis, but I was awake when this happened and actually frequently jumped out of my bed seeing the bug and francticly started looking for it.\n\nEverytime I am 100% sure it's real, and I noticed the longer my eyes are open, the bug starts dissolving? I don't know how to put it, the transition from \"holy fuck that's a huge bug it's so close I can touch it fuck fuck fuck\" to \"where did it go?\" is seamless.\n\nI've been googling it lately and can't find anything, but what I did read is that any form of hallucination is not normal. I don't have any history of mental illness in my family, I did have a minor head injury when I was little (fractured skull) but I haven't had any consequenses from it. The doctors all say I'm just dreaming so I don't know who to turn to. I'm not on any medication except birth control. \n\nThank you to anyone who can shed some light on this!",
    "document": "Preclinical Polymodal Hallucinations for 13 Years before Dementia with Lewy Bodies\nObjective . We describe a case of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that presented long-lasting preclinical complex polymodal hallucinations.  Background . Few studies have deeply investigated the characteristics of hallucinations in DLB, especially in the preclinical phase. Moreover, the clinical phenotype of mild cognitive impairment-(MCI-) DLB is poorly understood.  Methods . The patient was followed for 4 years and a selective phenomenological and cognitive study was performed at the predementia stage.  Results . The phenomenological study showed the presence of hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations that allowed us to make a differential diagnosis between DLB and Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). The neuropsychological evaluation showed a multiple domain without amnesia MCI subtype with prefrontal dysexecutive, visuoperceptual, and visuospatial impairments and simultanagnosia, which has not previously been reported in MCI-DLB.  Conclusions . This study extends the prognostic value of hallucinations for DLB to the preclinical phases. It supports and refines the MCI-DLB concept and identifies simultanagnosia as a possible early cognitive marker. Finally, it confirms an association between hallucinations and visuoperceptual impairments at an intermediate stage of the disease course and strongly supports the hypothesis that hallucinations in the earliest stages of DLB may reflect a narcolepsy-like REM-sleep disorder.",
    "response": "These are hypnagogic hallucinations. They happen during the times of sleep transition from being awake to being asleep. Getting more sleep and reducing stress can reduce the severity. If they cause distress, you can see your doc for meds."
