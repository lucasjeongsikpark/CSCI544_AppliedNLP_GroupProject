You are evaluating the quality and correctness of a mathematical reasoning response.

Here is the math problem:
<problem>
{INPUT}
</problem>

Here is the expected correct answer:
<expected_answer>
{OUTPUT}
</expected_answer>

Here is the response to be evaluated:
<response>
{RESPONSE}
</response>

Evaluate each metric independently with a 1â€“5 score (integers only):
1 = Very Poor, 2 = Poor, 3 = Fair, 4 = Good, 5 = Excellent.

Metrics:
 - correctness: Correct final answer
 - reasoning: Logical, coherent step-by-step derivation
 - completeness: All necessary steps shown (no large gaps)
 - accuracy: Calculations/arithmetic are correct

Output format STRICTLY:
<metrics>
correctness: [1-5]
reasoning: [1-5]
completeness: [1-5]
accuracy: [1-5]
</metrics>
<overall_score>
An overall 1-5 integer (you may average & round or conservative lower bound)
</overall_score>
Optional scratchpad reasoning (if needed) enclosed:
<scratchpad>
(concise justification per metric; keep under 120 words)
