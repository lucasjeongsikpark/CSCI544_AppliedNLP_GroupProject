You are evaluating the quality and correctness of a mathematical reasoning response.

Here is the math problem:
<problem>
{INPUT}
</problem>

Here is the expected correct answer:
<expected_answer>
{OUTPUT}
</expected_answer>

Here is the response to be evaluated:
<response>
{RESPONSE}
</response>

Your task is to evaluate the quality of this mathematical response based on:
1. Correctness: Does it arrive at the correct answer?
2. Reasoning: Is the step-by-step reasoning clear and logical?
3. Completeness: Are all necessary steps shown?
