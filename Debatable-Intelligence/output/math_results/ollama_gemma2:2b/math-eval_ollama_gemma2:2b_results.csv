0,llama_output,Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

The response correctly identifies the steps to solve the problem, including calculating the number of eggs used for muffins and the remaining eggs. The calculations are accurate, and the reasoning is clear and logical.  There's a slight improvement in presentation by using numbered steps and a final answer box.

1,llama_output,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
