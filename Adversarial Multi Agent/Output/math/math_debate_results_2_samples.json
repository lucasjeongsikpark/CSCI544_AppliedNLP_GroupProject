        "final_argument_A": "The total number of bolts needed for the robe is indeed calculated by adding the blue fiber and white fiber together. Since one bolt of blue fiber is used along with half a bolt (or 0.5 bolts) of white fiber, the calculation becomes 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 bolts in total. This method ensures that all materials are accounted for accurately, providing a clear and concise solution.\n\n**Final Argument:**\nThe robe requires both blue and white fibers. Specifically, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber plus half of that quantity, which is 1 bolt of white fiber. By adding these together, we find the total number of bolts needed is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5. This straightforward calculation ensures all materials are accounted for accurately, resulting in a clear and precise solution.",
        "final_argument_B": "To determine the total number of bolts required to make the robe, let's break down each component step by step.\n\n1. **Blue Fiber Requirement:**\n   - The robe needs **2 bolts** of blue fiber.\n\n2. **White Fiber Requirement:**\n   - It also requires **half that much** white fiber.\n   - Half of 2 bolts is calculated as \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) bolt.\n   - Therefore, the white fiber needed is **1 bolt**.\n\n3. **Total Bolts Calculation:**\n   - Add the blue and white fibers together:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total bolts} = \\text{Blue fibers} + \\text{White fibers} = 2 + 1 = 3\n     \\]\n\n#### Final Answer  \n\\boxed{3}\n\n**Conclusion:** The robe requires a total of **3 bolts**."
